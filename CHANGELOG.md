# Changelog

All notable changes to this maintained fork are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

This release closes the two isolation gaps issue #331 tracked: send selection
now matches the complete partition and origin identity both engines persist,
and no projection that cannot represent that identity produces one silently.
See [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-isolation-safe-send-selection-and-explicit-isolation-loss.md)
for the decisions and
[the program record](docs/design/isolation-safe-send-selection.md) for how
they were implemented.

**Nothing is renamed.** `read`, `header`, `cookies`, `jar`, `as_jar`,
`as_list`, `detailed_cookies`, and every named compatibility helper keep their
names in every language, and every 0.6 call site still compiles: the opt-in
arrives as a defaulted keyword (`allow_isolation_loss`), a new options type
that is a superset of the old one (Node's `JarOptions`), or a separate method
(`jar_with`/`into_jar_with`). What changes is that some calls that always
succeeded can now fail, and that an explicit, named opt-in exists for the
caller who has already decided isolation loss is acceptable.

### Added

- `ReadResult::send_view` returns the cookies a `SendContext` selects, before
  they are flattened into a header string. It borrows the snapshot, so the
  selected rows keep their full `DetailedCookie` identity, and
  `SendView::omitted` reports how many rows were left out under each of seven
  stable reasons (`expired`, `not_applicable`, `same_site`, `partition`,
  `ancestor_chain_unknown`, `unparsable_partition_key`, `origin`), in a fixed
  serialization order, each row counted exactly once under the first stage it
  failed. `header` is now a thin renderer over this one operation, so no
  binding and no command can grow its own copy of the send-match predicate.
- `SendContext` gained four selectors: `ancestor_chain`, `first_party_domain`,
  `gecko_view_session_context_id`, and `origin_attributes`. `AncestorChain` is
  a new public `SameSite`/`CrossSite` enum. Without an explicit
  `ancestor_chain` the value is derived from the request and top-level sites,
  so an existing call site does not have to supply one; setting it is how a
  caller describes a nested `A -> B -> A` embed, which the derivation alone
  cannot see. The selector-token vocabulary gained `first_party_domain`,
  `gecko_view_session_context_id`, and `origin_attributes`, appended after the
  three tokens 0.6 defined rather than reordering them. `ancestor_chain` and
  the Firefox partition port are never demanded, because both are derived.
- `ReadResult::jar`, `into_jar`, `jar_with`, and `into_jar_with` are new
  methods, together with the public `IsolationLoss` enum (`Refuse` by default,
  `Allow` for the opt-in) and the new `RequestError::IsolationLossRefused`
  variant, code `isolation_loss_refused`, carrying `isolated_rows` and the
  same `required` selector tokens `IncompleteSendContext` uses. Today's
  infallible flatten is unchanged and still reached through
  `cookies()`/`into_cookies()`.
- A new `unknown_ancestor_chain` read warning counts partitioned Chromium rows
  whose store predates the `has_cross_site_ancestor` column, mirroring the
  existing `unparsable_partition_key` warning.
- **Python:** `ReadResult.send_view(...)` takes exactly `header`'s arguments
  and returns the same selection before it is flattened into a string — a dict
  of `"cookies"` (the selected records in header order, each the
  isolation-intact shape `detailed_cookies()` returns), `"header"` (those
  records rendered, byte-identical to `header(...)` for the same context,
  because both delegate to one core selection), and `"omitted"` (a count under
  each of the seven reasons, every key present with a zero when nothing failed
  for it, so indexing one needs no guard). An empty `"cookies"` is a
  legitimate answer, and `"omitted"` is what tells "this context has no
  cookies" apart from "everything was excluded, and here is what excluded it".
- **Python:** `ReadResult.header` and `send_view` gained four selector keyword
  arguments — `ancestor_chain` (`"same_site"` or `"cross_site"`),
  `first_party_domain`, `gecko_view_session_context_id`, and
  `origin_attributes` — appended after `now` rather than reordering the
  existing ones. Each is equally a key of the mapping form of `context`, and
  an unrecognized `ancestor_chain` spelling is a request error rather than a
  silent fall back to the derived chain. `origin_attributes` names a raw
  Firefox suffix verbatim and is the only way to reach a row carrying an
  attribute this build does not recognize.
- **Python:** `ReadResult.compatibility_cookies(*, allow_isolation_loss=False)`
  is the named escape hatch for the eight-field projection: the same rows and
  the same bytes as `as_list()` whenever it succeeds, but it refuses an
  isolated snapshot instead of flattening it. The stubs gained an
  `AncestorChain` literal alias and `SendOmissions` / `SendView` TypedDicts, so
  a typed consumer can name what `send_view` returns.
- **Node:** `ReadResult.sendView(context)` returns the selected
  `DetailedCookieObject[]` in header order, the rendered `header` string, and
  an `omitted` object carrying all seven omission reasons as numbers
  (`expired`, `notApplicable`, `sameSite`, `partition`, `ancestorChainUnknown`,
  `unparsablePartitionKey`, `origin`), zeroes included. `ReadResult.header` now
  renders from it rather than repeating the match. `SendContextObject` gained
  `ancestorChain` (typed as the new `AncestorChain` union,
  `'same_site' | 'cross_site'`; any other string rejects with `InvalidArg`),
  `firstPartyDomain`, `geckoViewSessionContextId`, and `originAttributes`.
  `RookieError.required` is now documented as covering `isolation_loss_refused`
  as well as `incomplete_send_context`.
- **CLI:** a `send-view` subcommand prints the whole selection behind `header`
  as one JSON object: `cookies` (the selected records, in the same
  serialization `--format detailed` emits), `header` (the string `header`
  would print), and `omitted` (every omission reason with its count, zeroes
  included, in the stable declared order). `header` and `send-view` share one
  flat selector — the existing `--url`, `--top-level-site`, `--resource`,
  `--method`, `--user-context-id` and `--private-browsing-id`, joined by the
  new `--ancestor-chain same-site|cross-site`, `--first-party-domain`,
  `--gecko-view-session-context-id`, `--origin-attributes`, and `--now <epoch
  seconds>` — so a context expressed for one command is expressible for the
  other. `from-path --domains` stays a flat, compatibility-only route and takes
  none of this surface.
- **CLI:** error objects may now carry a third field. The rule is unchanged in
  shape — every object has `code` and `message`, a given `code` may define
  further documented fields, and a consumer must ignore keys it does not
  recognize — and `required` is the first such field, defined for exactly
  `incomplete_send_context` and `isolation_loss_refused`. It lists the selector
  tokens the call is missing, drawing on the same vocabulary the Python and
  Node bindings already expose.

### Changed

- **Breaking.** `header` now matches the full partition identity both engines
  actually use, instead of reducing each engine's key to a scheme and a host.
  Chromium's `has_cross_site_ancestor` bit is part of the comparison, so two
  rows that differ only by ancestor chain no longer both match one context.
  Firefox's `partitionKey` is parsed strictly as `(scheme,host[,port][,f])`, so
  partitions differing only by port or by the foreign-ancestor bit are distinct
  identities, and a tuple in any other shape now matches nothing rather than
  matching on whichever leading fields happened to parse. All five Firefox
  `OriginAttributes` equality fields are compared, and a row carrying an
  attribute name this build does not recognize — or an unreadable value under
  one it does — is omitted from every send view until a caller names its
  `origin_attributes` value verbatim. That exact match is necessary, not
  sufficient: such a row still passes through the partition gate and the typed
  selectors.
- **Breaking.** A Chromium partition key that names an explicit port is no
  longer matched against a top-level site that does not. 0.6 stripped any
  trailing port from the key, which was the one step in the comparison that
  widened it. Chromium serializes a site without a port, so a key a current
  browser writes should not be affected.
- **Breaking.** A partitioned Chromium row whose store never recorded the
  ancestor bit is omitted from every send view rather than sent to any context
  whose key otherwise matches. Only a store last written by a Chromium older
  than the mid-2024 schema that added the column can lack it. The row stays in the snapshot inventory, and the loss is counted both
  per view (`ancestor_chain_unknown`) and as the `unknown_ancestor_chain` read
  warning, so it is visible rather than silent.
- **Breaking.** Two send-match outcomes change for Firefox rows that 0.6 got
  wrong in opposite directions. `user_context_id(0)` and
  `private_browsing_id(0)` now select rows whose stored suffix omits the
  attribute, where 0.6 matched nothing at all: Firefox omits a default-valued
  attribute, so a present suffix is a positive statement that the row is in the
  default container. And a partitioned Firefox row is no longer sent to a
  first-party context, where 0.6 sent it: a partition is by construction not
  the unpartitioned default.
- **Breaking.** Same-site now means that the request host equals the top-level
  site's host or is a subdomain of it, on the same scheme. It previously meant
  literal host equality. A request to `www.example.com` under a
  `https://example.com` top-level site is therefore same-site where it used to
  be cross-site. Sibling subdomains remain cross-site, because neither is a
  subdomain of the other, and an IPv4 or IPv6 literal on either side requires
  exact host equality — which is what keeps this sound without a public-suffix
  list. The rule only widens what `SameSite=Lax` and `SameSite=Strict` admit;
  nothing that was sent before is withheld now. A request is same-site only
  when the two sites match and no ancestor is cross-site, so the new
  `ancestor_chain` selector set to `CrossSite` withholds `Lax` and `Strict`
  even on a first-party URL, which is how a browser treats an `A -> B -> A`
  frame.
- **Breaking.** `jar` fails closed. The free `jar` function, `ReadResult::jar`,
  and `ReadResult::into_jar` refuse a snapshot that holds a partitioned,
  containered, or otherwise isolated cookie, returning the new
  `isolation_loss_refused` request error rather than a flat list that has
  silently merged two browsing contexts. The eight-field shape has no cell for
  a partition key or a container id, so a successful call used to be
  indistinguishable from one that dropped scoped credentials into an unscoped
  bag. A snapshot with no isolated rows returns `Ok` exactly as before.

  To keep the previous behavior, say so: `ReadResult::jar_with` and
  `ReadResult::into_jar_with` take the new `IsolationLoss` enum, and
  `IsolationLoss::Allow` produces byte-for-byte the same list as before. The
  error carries how many rows are isolated and the same selector tokens
  `incomplete_send_context` uses, so one handler covers both.

  `cookies()` and `into_cookies()` are unaffected and stay infallible. They are
  the inventory projection, for seeing what the browser stored; `jar` is the
  one that promises the result is safe to send.
- **Breaking (Python).** `ReadResult.as_jar()` and the free `jar(...)` fail
  closed on isolation loss, the same policy the Rust `jar` gained. An
  `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` has no field for a CHIPS partition key, a Firefox
  `partitionKey` tuple, or container identity, so a snapshot holding any
  isolated row now raises `RookieRequestError` with
  `code == "isolation_loss_refused"` rather than returning a jar that looks
  correct and holds credentials scoped to a context the caller never named.
  Both gained `allow_isolation_loss: bool = False`; passing `True` produces
  byte-for-byte what they returned before, and a snapshot with no isolated rows
  is unaffected. `as_list()` is also unaffected and stays infallible — it is
  the inventory projection, for looking at raw rows rather than sending them —
  and `to_cookiejar` / `to_netscape` remain pure functions with no policy of
  their own.
- **Python:** the `required` attribute on `RookieRequestError` is now
  populated for `isolation_loss_refused` as well as `incomplete_send_context`,
  drawing on one selector vocabulary. For the former it names the selectors a
  `send_view()` / `header()` call would need for that snapshot; for the latter,
  the ones the call did not receive. Code that already branches on one's
  `required` needs no second vocabulary, and the attribute stays present and
  empty on every other error.
- **Breaking (Node).** `jar` fails closed and takes a new `JarOptions`. Against
  a snapshot holding a partitioned or containered cookie it now rejects with
  `rookieCode === "isolation_loss_refused"`, whose `required` names the same
  selector tokens `sendView`/`header` demand, instead of resolving a flat
  `CookieObject[]` that has silently merged two browsing contexts. Pass
  `allowIsolationLoss: true` to opt in; the resolved value is then
  byte-for-byte `read(...).cookies`, and a snapshot with no isolated rows
  resolves either way exactly as before. `JarOptions` is every `ReadOptions`
  field plus that flag — deliberately not on `ReadOptions` itself, where a
  non-jar call would have silently ignored it; `read` and `fromPath` reject
  the flag by name, before any I/O, rather than accepting and dropping it.
  `snapshot.cookies` and `snapshot.detailedCookies` are unaffected.
- **Breaking (CLI).** `read` and `from-path` now route `--format json` and
  `--format netscape` through the fail-closed jar, so a snapshot holding
  isolated cookies exits 1 with `isolation_loss_refused` instead of printing a
  flat list that has silently merged two browsing contexts. Neither format has
  a column for a partition key or a container identity, which is exactly why
  the refusal exists. To keep the previous output, pass the new
  `--allow-isolation-loss` flag: it produces byte-for-byte what the command
  printed before. `--format detailed` carries the context and is never
  refused, so it needs no flag.

  `from-path --domains` is covered by the same policy. Its one
  `extract_from_path` acquisition retains the detailed rows long enough to
  check isolation, then projects those exact rows to the flat result. A browser
  write cannot land between separate policy and output reads. Successful
  output remains byte-identical; an isolated selected row now refuses there
  too instead of leaving one route where a merged list still printed.
- Read-warning text now reads `N rows affected (code)` rather than
  `skipped N rows (code)`, in Rust, Python, and Node alike. Not every warning
  code drops a row: `unparsable_partition_key` and `unknown_ancestor_chain`
  count rows the snapshot keeps and no send context can select, so "skipped"
  was wrong for them. The `code` and `count` fields are unchanged and remain
  the thing to branch on; this text has never been a stable contract.

### Fixed

- Hosted claimed-browser cookie seeding no longer loses a run to a single
  stalled attempt. A branded fork that accepts the DevTools connection but
  never navigates now gets a bounded number of fresh corpus targets against the
  same launch root, a partially seeded corpus still fails immediately rather
  than restarting an interleaving redirect chain, the corpus poll window is
  overridable per browser, the post-shutdown cookie-flush wait spans bounded
  logged windows, and each hosted-CI launch first reaps leftover processes of
  its own launch root and product so a stale vendor service cannot contend
  with it.
- Linux Chromium v11 cookies now fall back to the empty-password key when the
  OS keyring yields no usable password. The keyring password, when there is
  one, is still tried first; the empty-password key is appended as a last
  candidate so profiles Chromium sealed with its own `BASICTEXT` fallback (no
  reachable Secret Service or KWallet) and profiles whose keyring entry is
  stale are decryptable instead of failing the whole v11 tier. A value that
  the fallback cannot open is still reported with the keyring diagnostic and
  its retryability, so the fallback adds decryptions without hiding why the
  keyring lookup failed.

### Removed

- The `flat_only` value for a browser registry root's `legacy_profile_layout`
  is retired. Opera was its only declarant, and its refusal to fall back to a
  sibling `Default` profile was the discovery defect fixed in 0.6.0; since
  `flat_and_default` behaves identically wherever no `Default` directory
  exists, nothing is left for the name to describe. `browser_registry.json`
  now fails to load if any root declares it, naming `flat_and_default` as the
  replacement rather than silently falling back to the default layout.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Python binding coverage is now measured and ratcheted. A pull-request job
  instruments the extension, runs the installed-wheel suite against it, and
  holds every `bindings/python/src/*.rs` file plus `__init__.py` and `dto.py`
  to per-file line and branch floors; the nightly schedule repeats it on
  Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Every public Python export is now held to a declarative contract covering
  its platform availability, stub presence, parameter shape and defaults, one
  success path, and one classified-error path.
- Runtime/stub compatibility is now checked against the installed wheel with
  `mypy.stubtest` and a type-consumer fixture, against a committed allowlist
  of the documented divergences.
- Each browser-specific convenience function now receives an exact-corpus
  assertion on the platforms where it exists, or a documented exception in
  `tests/e2e/browser_coverage.json`.

### Changed

- The CLI documentation now defines its stderr contract: typed library errors
  emit JSON with stable `code` and human `message` fields, while usage,
  wrapped, and non-library errors retain human-readable output.
- The Node binding build now uses napi-rs v3 while preserving the existing
  runtime exports, TypeScript surface, Node-API v4 baseline, and Node.js 22
  minimum.
- Real-browser validation now compares complete controlled cookie corpora
  across Rust, Python, Node, and CLI surfaces, including active stores,
  partition/container isolation, and concurrent stress cases.

### Fixed

- Opera and Opera GX compatibility helpers on macOS and Windows now fall back
  to a Chromium-style `Default` profile after checking the historical flat
  profile, and source absence no longer appears as a failed-enumeration error
  with an empty diagnostic.
- Browser profile listing now reports a timeout or cancellation as an error
  instead of returning a partial Gecko, Safari, or Internet Explorer listing
  that appears complete.
- Node structured errors retain their native diagnostic when a decoded payload
  omits `message`, and the serialization fallback always emits valid JSON.
- Firefox's stored SameSite sentinel `256` is normalized to the public
  unspecified value instead of being exposed as an unknown storage value.
- SQLite live-store lock polling now observes request deadlines and
  cancellation rather than entering one opaque busy wait.
- WAL snapshots now verify the sidecar and recheck the main database before
  use, preventing a concurrent Firefox write or checkpoint from yielding a
  stale but otherwise readable cookie snapshot.
- Release-control checks no longer let a newer, intentionally skipped copy of
  a dispatch-only gate mask the successful exact-commit release run.
- The Python type stub no longer leaves `jar()` and `ReadResult.as_jar()`
  returning an unresolvable type, so consumers infer `http.cookiejar.CookieJar`
  rather than `Any`.
- Platform-conditional Python exports are now hidden from type checkers on
  platforms that do not provide them. Calling `cachy()` on macOS, `safari()`
  on Linux, or `internet_explorer()` anywhere but Windows is now a type error
  instead of type-checking clean and failing at runtime.

## [0.6.0-beta.3] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- crates.io publication now uses its GitHub OIDC trusted publisher instead of
  a stored registry token, and PyPI publication can recover an interrupted run
  by reconciling the original digest-verified distributions.
- Release manifests are now recomputed before every consumer-harness and CI
  proof check, and release preparation rejects an empty changelog section.
- The Rust workspace now declares and continuously tests Rust 1.88 as its MSRV;
  the published crate also declares crates.io categories.
- Windows ESET scan records remain available for incident investigation but are
  no longer described as a release gate.

## [0.6.0-beta.2] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Rust and Node now expose `jar` alongside Python. It is projection sugar for
  `read`: Rust returns `Vec<Cookie>`, Node resolves to `CookieObject[]`, and
  both discard snapshot warnings and isolation context just as Python's
  `read(...).as_jar()` projection does.
- **Three path request types become two.** `DirectPathRequest` and
  `ChromiumPathRequest` are replaced by `PathExtractRequest` +
  `extract_from_path`; `DirectPathRequest` was `ChromiumPathRequest` minus
  credentials minus the locked-database policy, so the pair was one type split
  by whether the caller happened to know the file was Chromium. Constructors:
  `plaintext`, `sniff`, and the platform-gated `unix_identity` (Unix) /
  `windows_local_state` (Windows).
  `ChromiumCredentialSource::Automatic` is gone: it was the default and it
  could never succeed on Windows. Isolation-carrying path output now comes
  from `from_path(..).detailed_cookies()`, so the Rust free function backing
  `chromium_cookies_from_path_detailed` is gone too — a real narrowing at that
  layer, since a domain-filtered *detailed* path list is no longer expressible
  through it. **Python keeps the function** (now backed by
  `from_path(..).into_detailed_cookies()`) but drops its `domains` option:
  passing `domains` raises `RookieRequestError` rather than the binding
  reimplementing the core's `pub(crate)` matching rule to fake the filter
  back. Python's `from_path()` gains `plaintext_only` / `browser_id` /
  `local_state_path` keyword arguments (mutually exclusive, validated with
  the now-wired-up `conflicting_credential_selectors` code before any I/O)
  for the same credential selection `chromium_cookies_from_path`'s options
  dict already offered.
- Sniffing a Chromium database is plaintext-capable only; an encrypted row is
  the new `missing_chromium_credentials`. On Unix that is a narrowing (the
  ordered identity probe is gone). On Windows it is a widening: the old call
  returned `missing_local_state_file` before attempting extraction, so even a
  fully plaintext database failed.
- **`ProfileSelection` and `ReportScope` make an illegal selection
  unrepresentable.** `Request` is renamed `ExtractRequest` (prerelease-only)
  and joined by `ReportRequest`, whose scope may widen to every profile
  because only a report can describe more than one. `ExtractRequest::browser`
  selects the first legacy-eligible profile; `ReportRequest::browser` reports
  every profile, matching v0.5.9's `browser_report(id, None, ..)`.
  `From<ExtractRequest> for ReportRequest` narrows, never widens.
- **`ReadResult::header` takes a `SendContext`** instead of a bare URL, and is
  send-safe: it never merges two isolated browsing contexts. A snapshot holding
  a partitioned or containered cookie demands the selector that identifies it
  and raises `RequestError::IncompleteSendContext` (with a stable `required`
  token list) rather than guessing. New `SendContext`, `ResourceKind`, and
  `MethodClass`; `SameSite` is now applied, with `Site` defined as
  (scheme, host). Firefox `partitionKey` tuples and Chromium
  `top_frame_site_key` values are normalized into that one space, so a Firefox
  dFPI cookie is matched rather than silently absent from every header. New
  warning `unparsable_partition_key` for a key neither parser understands —
  such a row is a non-match everywhere, never treated as unpartitioned.
- **`ReadResult` is isolation-aware on both source axes.** Its native
  representation is `DetailedCookie`, so a CHIPS partition key or a Firefox
  container survives to `header()`. New: `detailed_cookies()`,
  `into_detailed_cookies()`, `common::format::detailed_json`, and CLI
  `--format detailed`. `cookies()` keeps its `&[Cookie]` signature, backed by a
  projection built once at construction. `Cookie` gains `Clone`/`PartialEq`/
  `Eq`/`Hash`; `DetailedCookie` gains `Clone`/`PartialEq`/`Eq`.
- `SessionPolicy` and `ReadRequest::include_session()`. Session cookies used to
  be an accident of naming a profile; they are now their own question, and
  `read(ReadRequest::browser("firefox").include_session())` is expressible for
  the first time.
- Rust: `ExecutionControl` (timeout, cancellation, and the new
  `AppBoundPolicy`) composed once into every request type instead of copied
  per type, plus `execution(..)` setters and `load_report_with`,
  `browser_profiles_with`, `chrome_profiles_with`, `profiles_with`, and
  `LoadReportRequest` so the stable v0.5.9 listing and aggregate signatures can
  stay unchanged while still taking control.
- Rust: one typed public `Error` (`Request` / `Stopped` / `Source` / `Engine`)
  with a stable `code()` on every variant, plus `EngineError` carrying the
  `no_selected_source`, `no_discovered_source`, `discovery_failed`, and
  `engine_failure` codes. Direct-path I/O/SQLite inspection failures also keep
  their existing `source_inspection_failed` code while classifying as engine
  failures rather than caller mistakes. Those codes were previously
  unrecoverable: the sites that produce them raised formatted strings. Python
  gains `RookieError`,
  `RookieStoppedError`, and `RookieSourceError` beside the existing request and
  engine exceptions; Node's `kind` is now `request` / `stopped` / `source` /
  `engine`.
- Native linux-arm64 artifacts: PyPI manylinux aarch64 wheel, npm
  `rookie-cookies-linux-arm64-gnu`, and a CLI
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` binary, all built on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`.
- Node and Python errors expose stable request/engine identity, library fault
  codes, stop reasons, ambiguous-profile IDs, and redacted direct-path
  metadata. Node read warnings also report when their count was saturated to
  JavaScript's `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (`2^53 - 1`).
- The generated report JSON Schema now enforces the same lexical constraints
  as Rust for open vocabulary identifiers and opaque installation/profile IDs.
- Python `ReadResult` gains `detailed_cookies()`: isolation-intact records,
  each `{"cookie": <8-field dict>, "context": {...}}`, backed by the core's
  `detailed_cookies()`. New warning codes `malformed_host_identity` and
  `unparsable_partition_key` surface through the existing `ReadWarning.code`
  string, no binding change needed.
- Python `read()` / `jar()` gain `include_session: bool = False` and
  `select: Literal["legacy_first"] = "legacy_first"`; `browser_report()` gains
  `select: Literal["legacy_first", "all"] = "all"`. Passing `profile=`/
  `profile_id=` together with `select="all"` (or `select="all"` to
  `read`/`jar` at all, which cannot express it) raises `RookieRequestError`
  with `code == "conflicting_profile_selection"` before any I/O.
- Python `ReadResult.header()` accepts a `SendContext`-shaped mapping or
  keyword arguments (`top_level_site`, `resource`, `method`,
  `user_context_id`, `private_browsing_id`, `now`) in addition to a bare URL
  string, mirroring Rust's `SendContext`. `RookieRequestError` gains a
  `required: list[str]` attribute naming the selectors an
  `incomplete_send_context` fault was missing (empty for every other kind).

### Removed

- The Linux Arc registry entry. Arc's vendor does not ship or support Arc on
  Linux; the macOS and Windows registrations remain.
- PyPI wheels for linux i686, armv7, s390x, and ppc64le. Those arches have
  no desktop browser cookie store this project can honestly support.

### Changed

- A direct-path `SourceInspectionFailed` caused by an I/O, SQLite, locked, or
  corrupt-file inspection failure is now `Error::Engine` / deprecated
  `FaultKind::Engine`; Python raises `RookieEngineError`/`RuntimeError`, and
  Node reports `kind == "engine"` with `GenericFailure`. The stable
  `source_inspection_failed` machine code and sanitized diagnostic are
  unchanged. Caller-correctable path, source-kind, platform, and option
  failures remain `Error::Source` / `RookieSourceError` / `InvalidArg`.

- **Breaking (Rust):** `rookie_cookies::Result<T>` is now
  `Result<T, rookie_cookies::Error>`. It was `anyhow::Result<T>` through
  v0.5.9. A caller who wrote `rookie_cookies::Result<T>` around a bridge
  function should use `rookie_cookies::anyhow::Result<T>`, which still
  resolves. The deprecated v0.5.9 bridge functions are unaffected: they keep
  returning `anyhow::Result`, spelled explicitly. `Error` implements
  `std::error::Error + Send + Sync`, so `?` from the new surface into an
  `anyhow` call site keeps working.
- **Breaking (Python):** a timeout, cancellation, or resource-exhaustion stop
  now raises `RookieStoppedError`, not `RookieEngineError`. The two-way
  request/engine split had no separate bucket for a cooperative stop, so it
  fell under the engine class; the new four-way split gives it its own class.
  Code that caught `RookieEngineError` to read `stop_reason` must catch
  `RookieStoppedError` instead. `kind` is `request` / `stopped` / `source` /
  `engine` (was `request` / `engine`).
- **One `Request` value no longer selects differently depending on which
  function it is passed to.** In 0.6-beta the same value meant "the first
  legacy-eligible profile" to `extract` and "every profile" to
  `extract_report` — two calls that looked identical and read different
  profiles. That is now a type-level distinction.
- Engine extraction seams take the typed internal `ProfileSelection` instead
  of `Option<&str>`, which could only express "one profile" or "all" and made
  the legacy-first scope inexpressible on the report path.
- **A profile-scoped `read` no longer flows through the report builder.** The
  report DTO is frozen at `schema_version: 1` and carries the eight-field
  `Cookie`, so a snapshot flattened out of it had already lost
  `CookieContext` — `header()` would have seen no isolated cookies and merged
  partitions on the recommended path. `read` now stops at the finalized record
  and projects `DetailedCookie` for both single-profile selections.
- **Breaking:** `ReadResult::browser_id()` returns `Option<&str>` instead of
  `&str`. It was the empty string for `from_path`, an in-band sentinel a caller
  had to know about. Python exposes `Optional[str]`, Node `string | null`.
- **Breaking (Gecko):** `.profile(q)` alone no longer imports session cookies.
  `SessionPolicy` defaults to `PersistentOnly`, enforced before lookup, so the
  crate does not open `sessionstore.js` or `recovery.jsonlz4` unless asked.
  Pass `include_session()` (Rust), `include_session=True` (Python),
  `includeSession: true` (Node), or `--include-session` (CLI). This fails
  quietly — a smaller list, no error. Report jobs are unaffected: they always
  retain session sources.
- A row whose required host identity did not survive decode is omitted rather
  than emitted as `domain: ""`, which matches nothing and belongs to no site.
  Snapshots count it under the new `malformed_host_identity` warning; reports
  record it as a source issue of the same name; `extract` inherits the omission
  and not the count, because a bare `Vec<Cookie>` has nowhere to put it — use
  `read` or `extract_report` when the count matters. Unknown *optional*
  isolation fields stay `None` and never drop a row.
- **Windows App-Bound (v20) recovery is now an explicit per-request policy.**
  `AppBoundPolicy` defaults to `InjectionOnly`: unprivileged reflective COM
  injection (Chrome 127+), but **never** the elevated SYSTEM impersonation
  that `AllowElevatedFallback` permits — that now has to be asked for out
  loud. `Disabled` performs no injection, no browser spawn, no process
  enumeration and no impersonation at all; v20 rows are then skipped and
  surface as `decrypt_failed` read warnings with a `provider_failed` report
  issue naming the policy as the cause.
  The default is `InjectionOnly` rather than `Disabled` because Chrome has
  written v20 cookies on Windows since Chrome 127, so on a current profile
  essentially every row is v20 — a `Disabled` default would return an empty
  list for the most common Windows case, and would leave the deprecated
  v0.5.9 bridge *more* capable than the recommended API. Injection is still
  not free of consequence: it spawns a browser process and writes into it,
  which endpoint security products can flag, so pass `Disabled` where that
  matters.
  The deprecated v0.5.9 bridge keeps `AllowElevatedFallback`, so its 0.5.8
  capability is unchanged. Python's `read`, `from_path`, `browser_report`, and
  `load_report` take `app_bound: str = "injection_only"` (`"disabled"` /
  `"injection_only"` / `"allow_elevated_fallback"`); an unrecognized string
  raises `RookieRequestError` before any I/O. Node's `appBound` and the CLI's
  `--app-bound` follow the same default. `browser_profiles` and
  `chrome_profiles` take no `app_bound` parameter, since listing does no
  App-Bound work.
- `ROOKIE_E2E_APPBOUND_MODE` no longer steers a published build. It is compiled
  in only under `cfg(test)` or the off-by-default `e2e-appbound-steering`
  feature, and even there it can only narrow what the request policy already
  permits -- it can never widen one or override `Disabled`.
- Internal stop classification no longer round-trips a typed value through the
  report DTO's `termination` string. `TerminationCode` exists only at the wire
  edge; the flatten seam behind `extract` reads the enum.
- Single-browser compatibility APIs now return typed timeout, cancellation,
  and resource-exhaustion errors instead of silently returning partial
  cookies. Flat Rust `load()` retains its documented best-effort behavior for
  cookies committed by browsers already in flight when the shared job stops.
- Profile-scoped `extract()` and `read()` resolve the profile once and share
  one absolute deadline across resolution and extraction.
- `ReadResult::header()` now re-checks expiration at send time and excludes a
  cookie whose expiry equals the current second. `include_expired` controls
  snapshot inventory only. Profile-scoped and compatibility reads now project
  the same decrypt and row-read warning categories.
- Node `fromPath` and the CLI `from-path` command reject every combination of
  conflicting Chromium credential selectors before source I/O. Python option
  shape failures consistently use `RookieRequestError`.
- **Breaking (CLI):** the former top-level flag modes are replaced by required
  job subcommands: `read`, `from-path`, `header`, `report`, `profiles`, and
  `browsers`. Explicit paths are positional to `from-path`, and the Windows
  Chromium credential option is now `--local-state-path`; top-level `--path`,
  `--browser`, `--load`, `--report`, `--list-*`, and `--key-path` are not
  accepted by the current CLI.
- Stopped report work now carries a typed request issue and cannot be reported
  as ordinary `no_sources`; completed source data remains available with a
  partial status. Finalization issues preserve causes including decrypt,
  decode, encrypted, provider-unavailable, and provider-failed.
- CI is split into PR, nightly, and release lanes. Pull requests run one
  `check` job per OS (fmt, package, metadata, cargo-audit, rust lint+test,
  public API), and stagger Node build+test (22/24/26)
  plus Python build+tests (3.12/3.13/3.14)
  across Ubuntu/macOS/Windows. The full Node and Python version product,
  FreeBSD, packaging wheels/sdist, Chrome/Firefox e2e, and artifact smoke
  move to nightly / `main`. A small real Chrome/Firefox gate now also runs on
  pull requests. Extra hosted browsers (Edge, Chromium, Brave, Opera, Opera GX,
  Vivaldi, Yandex, LibreWolf, Zen, Safari)
  are installed on the runner when a silent installer exists. Claimed-browser
  fixtures remain for products we cannot install. Extra hosted browsers run on
  nightly and again on release. Claimed-browser fixtures run on
  `v*` tags, GitHub Releases, or `workflow_dispatch`.
- Releases now fail closed unless the exact tagged commit passes the full
  language/OS, artifact, assurance, security, real-browser, and claimed-browser
  suites. A guarded workflow-only npm bootstrap can create a new contract
  package with the release environment token before its trusted publisher can
  be configured; established packages remain OIDC-only.
- The Safari hosted canary uses the normal application profile because Apple
  intentionally destroys SafariDriver automation storage at session teardown.
  Internet Explorer remains fixture-only because current hosted images expose
  only Edge IE mode, which cannot produce the legacy `CookieEntryEx` ESE store
  supported by the deprecated decoder.
- macOS Chromium now reads its vendor-defined `Chromium Safe Storage` /
  `Chromium` Keychain identity rather than mixing the Chrome service with the
  Chromium account.
- `docs/testing.md` lists every registry browser against hosted CI, release
  fixtures, or manual coverage.

### Deprecated

- Rust `load()` is superseded by `read(ReadRequest::browser(...))` for
  snapshots and `load_report()` for grouped diagnostics. `CookieToString` is
  an unfiltered compatibility formatter; use
  `ReadResult::header(&SendContext)` for a send-scoped header view.
- The free `stop_reason` / `fault_kind` functions and `Error::fault_kind`.
  `FaultKind` is a two-way FFI split that collapses three of `Error`'s four
  variants; match on `Error`, or compare `Error::code()`.
- Rust `browser(id, domains)`, superseded by
  `extract(ExtractRequest::browser(id).domains(..))`. It was missing a
  `#[deprecated]` and is scheduled for deletion in 0.7.0.
- The crate-root `pub use anyhow` re-export, superseded by
  `rookie_cookies::Error` / `rookie_cookies::Result`. **The compiler cannot
  warn on this one:** `#[deprecated]` on a `pub use` of an external crate root
  does not fire for `rookie_cookies::anyhow::Result<T>`. The attribute is
  present so rustdoc shows the banner, and this entry is the notice. It is
  also, deliberately, the escape hatch for the `Result` alias break above, so
  it stays working for the whole 0.6.x line.

### Fixed

- macOS Yandex now declares its `Yandex Safe Storage` / `Yandex` Keychain
  identity and encrypted `v10` tier. Claimed Chromium forks create the seed
  tab through their native DevTools endpoint, avoiding Playwright persistent
  context hangs and vendor startup pages that ignore a positional URL.

- Artifact smoke on Ubuntu ARM64: maturin-action's manylinux container left
  `RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache` in the host job environment, so the native Node
  binding build failed looking for a host `sccache`.
- The Windows legacy-DPAPI real-browser canary now gives system Chrome the
  same bounded 120-second cold-start allowance as the Ubuntu canary. Chrome
  151 could exceed Playwright's 30-second default before extraction began;
  cookie extraction and validation assertions are still never retried.
- FreeBSD and other unsupported Unix targets again compile the Unix
  direct-path identity constructor. It preserves the request value so the
  platform leaf can return the typed `unsupported_target` result at execution.

## [0.6.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Rust `RequestError` classifies unknown browser / empty / unknown / ambiguous /
  lossy profile selectors, missing browser, and invalid header URLs as request
  faults. Unknown browser on `resolve_registered_browser` is `FaultKind::Request`.
- `Request::profile` and `extract_report`. `browser_report`'s middle argument
  now accepts the same profile query (id, name, directory, non-lossy path, or
  persistent cookie-DB path). CLI `--profile` requires `--browser` only.
- Job API: `read` / `ReadResult` (`into_cookies`, `header`) / `ReadWarning`
  (`code`, `count`) / `from_path` / `profiles`. Python also exports `jar` and
  `report`. Node exports `read`, `profiles`, `report`, `fromPath`. CLI
  subcommands `read`, `profiles`, `report`, `from-path`, `header`.
- ADR 0004: `read` is the recommended entry.

### Changed

- Documentation rehaul for 0.6: package-owned language guides (`read` / `jar`),
  Chrome/Edge/Brave App-Bound v20 coverage notes, and migration from 0.5.6.
- `browser_report` widens non-id profile queries that previously always failed.
- `firefox_profile` now resolves through `extract(Request::browser("firefox").profile(q))`.
- Recommended docs entry is `jar(browser=…)` / `read(…).as_list()`.

### Deprecated

- `chrome_profile`, `firefox_profiles`, and the `firefox_profile` selector
  retarget to `extract` / `extract_report` / `browser_profiles`.

## [0.6.0-alpha.3] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Windows Chrome-family browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge, CocCoc, and Avast) can
  decrypt App-Bound (v20) cookies via reflective COM injection into a spawned
  browser process, without administrator privilege. Elevated SYSTEM
  impersonation remains available as a fallback when injection is unavailable.

## [0.6.0-alpha.2] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Rust gains `FaultKind`/`fault_kind(&anyhow::Error)`, classifying an error as
  a request fault (bad input, e.g. an invalid explicit source) or an engine
  fault, alongside the existing `stop_reason()`. Python's `RookieRequestError`
  (a `ValueError` subclass) and `RookieEngineError` (a `RuntimeError`
  subclass) and Node's `InvalidArg`/`GenericFailure` error statuses now use
  this classification instead of one flat error type for every failure.
- Python gains `rookie_cookies.dto`, typed dataclasses for the canonical
  report/descriptor shapes (`ExtractionReport`, `BrowserDescriptor`, `Cookie`,
  etc.) generated from a new `schema/report-dto.schema.json`, with a
  `from_dict()` classmethod converting the existing dict-shaped return values.
  This is additive; every function's existing dict return type is unchanged.
- Python and Node.js now expose canonical `cookies_from_path` / `cookiesFromPath`
  and explicit Chromium path APIs with credential options matching Rust's typed
  direct-path builders. The CLI adds `--browser-id` and `--plaintext-only`.
- Rust's `Request`, `DirectPathRequest`, and `ChromiumPathRequest` gain
  `.timeout(Duration)` and a new `CancellationHandle`/`.cancellation(...)` for
  cooperative, cross-thread cancellation of an in-flight extraction, plus a
  `stop_reason()` helper reporting why an extraction stopped early --
  `TimedOut`, `Cancelled`, or `ResourceExhausted`. Node's
  `cookiesFromPath`, `chromiumCookiesFromPath(Detailed)`, and every
  single-browser export (`firefox`, `chrome`, `safari`, etc.) accept matching
  `timeoutMs`/`cancellation` parameters, via a new `CancellationHandle` class.
  Python's `cookies_from_path` gains matching `timeout`/`cancellation` keyword
  arguments, and `chromium_cookies_from_path(_detailed)` gain matching
  `timeout`/`cancellation` options-dict keys, via a new `CancellationHandle`
  class; Python's other named-browser functions (`firefox`, `chrome`, etc.)
  are unchanged. The CLI's `--browser` and `--path` modes now cancel cleanly
  on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` instead of aborting mid-extraction (a second signal
  forces an immediate exit), and no longer panics on a closed downstream pipe
  (e.g. `rookie-cookies --load | head -1`).

### Changed

- **Breaking (0.6.0):** Python's `cookies_from_path` and
  `chromium_cookies_from_path(_detailed)` now raise `RookieRequestError` (a
  `ValueError` subclass) instead of `RuntimeError` for a request fault (e.g. a
  missing or malformed explicit source, or mutually exclusive options); an
  `except RuntimeError` around one of these three functions no longer catches
  that case. Every other function's error type is unchanged. Node's thrown
  error `.status`/`.code` moves from always `Unknown` to `InvalidArg` (request
  faults) or `GenericFailure` (everything else) across every export.
- Rust's `load()` and `load_report()` now probe registered browsers
  concurrently on a small bounded worker pool sharing one deadline/
  cancellation budget, instead of one browser at a time. A slow or hung
  source no longer starves every other source's share of the shared budget.
  Results are always grouped by browser in the same fixed registry order
  regardless of completion order, and a per-source timeout or cancellation
  stops not-yet-started browsers without discarding results already
  completed by browsers that were in flight at that moment.
- **Breaking (0.6.0):** The Python package now requires CPython 3.11 or newer.
  CPython 3.8–3.10 and PyPy are no longer supported, and published wheels move
  from the `cp38-abi3` tag to `cp311-abi3`.
- **Breaking (0.6.0):** CLI `--key-path` is now always a Chromium Windows
  `Local State` credential selector. It requires `--path`, is mutually exclusive
  with `--browser-id` and `--plaintext-only`, and no longer remains silently
  ignored on Unix or beside a Firefox database. Inapplicable combinations now
  fail with the typed direct-path diagnostic.
- **Breaking (0.6.0):** The npm packages now require Node.js 22 or newer and
  are tested on Node.js 22, 24, and 26. Node.js 18 and 20 are no longer
  supported. The Node-API v4 ABI target is unchanged.
- `browser_registry.json` is now the single browser discovery and credential
  source for named APIs, profile/report APIs, bindings, and CLI modes. Named
  functions keep their flat first-profile behavior through an explicit
  compatibility selection policy, while `CONFIG` remains available as a
  registry-derived public compatibility view.
- In the Python and Node bindings, `any_browser`/`anyBrowser`, Chromium
  `*_based` functions, and flat Firefox `firefox_based`/`firefoxBased`
  functions are deprecated for removal no earlier than 0.7. Their 0.6 runtime
  signatures and behavior remain unchanged; detailed Firefox functions remain
  supported in those bindings.
- Rust's `internet_explorer()` and `internet_explorer_based()` are deprecated
  for removal, not just superseded by a newer call shape: their ESE-format
  cookie database is read through an unmodified native C library with no
  process isolation, and containing that is not worth building now that the
  Internet Explorer browser app is discontinued (2022). Their 0.6 behavior is
  unchanged.

### Removed

- Removed the duplicate internal `config.json` + `common/paths.rs` discovery
  stack. No public browser function or configuration type was removed.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Structured browser, profile, and extraction-report APIs now reach Rust,
  Python, Node.js, and the CLI with matching status, issue, counter, and cookie
  provenance semantics.
- The private browser registry now exposes the maintained platform variants,
  including Cốc Cốc and Yandex on macOS, Cốc Cốc, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, and Octo
  Browser on Windows, and Cachy Browser on Linux. Legacy named selectors remain
  source compatible.
- Detailed extraction preserves Chromium partition keys and Firefox container
  identities without changing the legacy `Cookie` wire shape.

### Changed

- Browser discovery is installation- and profile-aware across Chromium, Gecko,
  Safari, and Internet Explorer sources. Active Chromium profiles are preferred
  without hiding other discovered profiles.
- Extraction failures now remain typed and visible through reports and legacy
  APIs instead of collapsing into successful empty results.

### Fixed

- WAL-mode cookie databases with no pending WAL are now read through the
  verified private DB+WAL snapshot path. Read-only extraction no longer creates
  `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars in a live profile and works when the source directory
  is genuinely read-only, without hiding WAL frames behind an unsafe immutable
  open.
- Node extraction now converts native worker panics and invalid JavaScript
  arguments into rejected Promises instead of aborting Node or throwing before
  callers can attach Promise handlers. JavaScript examples now consistently
  await the asynchronous extraction API.
- Firefox session recovery accepts the browser-produced root cookie layout,
  bounds raw and decompressed session files, retains failed candidates, and
  handles seconds and milliseconds without coupling session data to the SQLite
  schema version.
- Chromium and Firefox schema-aware decoding now preserves valid metadata while
  counting and reporting malformed rows. Chromium v24 host-bound values are
  verified before their digest prefix is stripped.
- Safari and Internet Explorer parsing now retains partial results, reports
  malformed pages or records, and preserves security and SameSite semantics.
- macOS Keychain and Linux Secret Service/KWallet failures are explicit; KDE 6
  is supported and successful passwords are not discarded by cleanup errors.

### Security

- Persistent Chromium and Mozilla domain filters now enforce exact-host and
  subdomain boundaries after their SQL candidate query. Explicitly empty
  filters and blank domain entries no longer expose the entire cookie store.
- Chromium key candidates remain zeroizing from derivation through final use,
  and profile extraction no longer multiplies ordinary heap copies of master
  keys.
- Windows App-Bound impersonation restores any pre-existing thread identity and
  treats restoration failure as fatal.
- Release workflows bind every published artifact to one reviewed tag commit,
  recheck that tag immediately before publication, and require the tagged
  commit to be part of `main` history.
- Pull-request revalidation builds untrusted code without write credentials and
  reports statuses from a separate trusted job bound to the exact reviewed
  head SHA.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Windows App-Bound (v20) cookie decryption for Chrome 133+: the
  ChaCha20-Poly1305 (flag 2) and CNG-wrapped AES-256-GCM (flag 3) key-wrapping
  schemes, ported from the `runassu/chrome_v20_decryption` reference.
- `firefox_profiles()` and `firefox_profile()` in the Rust API, which enumerate
  every Firefox profile holding a cookie database and read cookies from a
  specific one selected by name, directory name, or path.

### Changed

- Python extraction releases the GIL, and Node.js extraction functions now run
  as asynchronous tasks so cookie reads do not block their host runtimes.
- Domain filtering now has consistent matching behavior across browser
  backends, including mixed SQL filters.
- Extraction now returns an aggregate error when every requested browser fails,
  while retaining the individual browser failures for diagnosis. Linux keyring
  and D-Bus failures are also surfaced instead of silently discarded.

### Fixed

- SQLite-backed browsers now copy active `-wal` and `-shm` files with the main
  database, preventing recently committed cookies from disappearing while the
  browser is open.
- Internet Explorer cookies now report `secure` and `http_only` from the ESE
  `Flags` column instead of always `false`, so a Secure cookie is no longer
  extracted as one safe to replay over plain HTTP. Flags that cannot be read
  fail closed: an unrecognised cookie table is an error, and an individual
  cookie whose flags do not decode is skipped rather than reported as
  insecure. Their `same_site` is now `-1` (unspecified) rather than `0`, which
  had claimed `SameSite=None` for a store that records no SameSite attribute
  at all.
- Firefox `profiles.ini` resolution no longer returns whichever `[Install...]`
  section comes first in the file. A single unambiguous install still wins, but
  competing installs (a release and a nightly sharing one `profiles.ini`) are
  now broken by the `[ProfileN] Default=1` marker, and an install section
  without a `Default=` key falls through to that marker instead of resolving to
  an empty path.
- Firefox cookie discovery now falls through to secondary profiles when the
  default profile has no `cookies.sqlite`, instead of giving up.
- Firefox `profiles.ini` is parsed with escape processing disabled, so an
  `IsRelative=0` profile storing an absolute Windows path such as
  `C:\Users\me\Profiles\work` is no longer mangled into
  `C:UsersmeProfileswork`.
- Windows App-Bound key derivation now parses the key-blob framing header
  instead of slicing a fixed trailing window, so Chrome 133+'s 93-byte flag-3
  key layout is decoded correctly (its scheme flag was previously read from the
  middle of the blob, leaving flag 3 unsupported).
- The CLI now sends tracing and log output to stderr so redirected stdout
  remains a valid cookie export.
- Chromium discovery includes the modern `Network/Cookies` location on macOS
  and Linux, and valid unencrypted plaintext cookies are preserved.
- Malformed cookie rows, truncated binary data, and out-of-range timestamps no
  longer discard an entire database or panic. Safari expiry timestamps are
  decoded as 64-bit floating-point values, and CBC decryption continues trying
  candidate keys after an invalid UTF-8 result.
- Source builds no longer fail when `git` is unavailable, watch the repository's
  actual `HEAD` for rebuilds, and include the packaged Rust examples.

### Security

- SQLite domain filters are parameterized rather than interpolated into SQL.
- Windows App-Bound extraction restores SYSTEM impersonation and
  `SeDebugPrivilege` on every path, removes shadow-copy temporary directories,
  and only force-closes a browser when explicitly enabled.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- A maintained fork published as `rookie-cookies` across crates.io, PyPI, and
  npm, with matching Rust, Python, Node.js, and CLI names.
- CPython 3.11–3.14 module tests and ABI3 wheel validation.
- Rust parser and helper tests, Python and Node.js module tests, CLI snapshot
  tests, and seeded Chrome/Firefox end-to-end coverage on Linux, macOS, and
  Windows.
- A release metadata validator and guarded first-release workflows for the
  Rust crate, Python wheels/source distribution, and five npm packages.
- Release, build, and maintained-fork documentation for downstream users such
  as `notebooklm-py`.

### Changed

- Browser extraction failures now emit per-browser warnings instead of being
  silently discarded.
- Python error handling uses `anyhow`, enabling current PyO3 and Python 3.13+
  builds.
- Node development, testing, and publication use npm consistently.
- Repository and package metadata now point to the maintained fork.

### Fixed

- Broken Rust doctests and CI coverage gaps.
- Python package version discovery with current Maturin releases.
- Chrome OS-crypt end-to-end setup on Linux, macOS, and Windows, including the
  Windows App-Bound Encryption path.
