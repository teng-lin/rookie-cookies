`rookie-cookies` is a well-tested cookie-extraction library for developers who
work across Python, JavaScript, and Rust. A single Rust core — exercised by
34 real-browser CI combinations across Linux/macOS/Windows, spanning Chrome,
Firefox, Edge, Brave, Opera, Opera GX, Vivaldi, Yandex, LibreWolf, Zen, and
Safari, including a live Windows App-Bound v20 canary against Chrome, Edge,
and Brave, see [Testing rigor](#how-rookie-cookies-compares) — backs native
Python and Node bindings and a CLI, so every language shares the same tested
decryption logic, including support for the latest Chrome v20 App-Bound
Encryption (ABE). See [How rookie-cookies
compares](#how-rookie-cookies-compares) for how that holds up against the
rest of the ecosystem.

This project started as a maintained fork of
[`thewh1teagle/rookie`](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/rookie), which is
archived. We still ship that project's public call shapes (`chrome()`,
`firefox()`, `load()`, and friends) so existing consumers keep working.

That compatibility is a **bridge, not a promise**. New work should use the
job API: `read` for a snapshot, then the send view (`send_view` in Rust and
Python, `sendView` in Node, `send-view` on the CLI) for anything you intend to
send. Later releases will break the old surface as we add capabilities and
clean up the design. Plan on migrating; do not take the legacy helpers as
frozen forever.

## What is different from upstream rookie

We keep the old names working while the library grows past a bag of
per-browser functions:

- One recommended job (`read`, plus the send view for what you will send)
  instead of “call `chrome()` and hope”.
- Profile queries so profile and Gecko session-source selection are explicit.
- Structured reports, explicit-path builders, timeouts, and cancellation.
- Chromium formats through **legacy DPAPI**, **`v10` / `v11`**, and **App-Bound
  `v20`** where the host and browser allow it.
- Shared tests across Rust, Python, Node, and the CLI.

Those additions are why the old API will eventually go away rather than stay
the documented default.

## How rookie-cookies compares

Cookie extraction has a lot of open-source options. Most are single-language
scripts that shell out to a system credential tool per lookup, and most stop
at Chrome's legacy `v10`/DPAPI cookies. Checked against source on 2026-08-22:

| | **rookie-cookies** | pycookiecheat | get-cookie | chrome-cookies-secure | yt-dlp `cookies.py` | HackBrowserData |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Browsers | 25, incl. Safari, IE, Zen, Cachy, Octo, Cốc Cốc, Yandex, Arc, DuckDuckGo, Avast, QQ, 360, Sogou, DC Browser | Chrome family + Firefox only | 11 Chromium/Gecko + Safari | Chrome only | 7 Chromium forks + Firefox + Safari | 19, incl. Safari, QQ, 360, Sogou, DC Browser; no IE, Zen, Cachy, Octo, LibreWolf |
| Bindings | Rust, Python, Node, CLI | Python only | Node/TS only | Node only | Python only, and not a published library surface | Go only, CLI binary — not designed for embedding |
| Chrome/Edge/Brave **v20 App-Bound** (127+, incl. 133+ flag-3) | ✓ COM injection + elevated DPAPI/CNG fallback | ✗ — no Windows Chromium support at all | ✗ | ✗ — broke outright on Chrome 130/131 | ✗ | partial — reflective-injection route; 133+ flag-3 elevated fallback unconfirmed |
| Windows DPAPI | built in | n/a | requires an optional npm package, throws if absent | requires a manual `optionalDependencies` install | built in | built in |
| Linux KWallet-corruption empty-key fallback | ✓ | ✗ | not implemented | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Output | structured report with typed issue taxonomy, jar, or list | dict / dataclass list | cookie objects / CLI formats | cookiejar / curl / header formats | `CookieJar`; failed rows silently dropped | CSV/JSON/db file dump via CLI; no structured issue taxonomy |
| Testing rigor | 34 real-browser CI combinations, 3 fuzz targets, scheduled OSV scans | ~623 lines of tests, no fuzzing, no browser-matrix CI | 82 test files, no fuzzing, no browser-matrix CI | no fuzzing or hardening signal observed | unit tests folded into yt-dlp's larger suite, no browser-matrix CI | CI + codecov, no fuzzing or real-browser E2E |
| CHIPS partition / Firefox container identity* | ✓ captured, preserved through `read()`/`DetailedCookie`, and matched on by the send view; the flat compatibility projection cannot carry it, so the inventory accessors (Rust `cookies()`, Python `as_list()`, Node `cookies`) drop it and the send-safe names (`jar`/`as_jar`, CLI `--format json\|netscape`) refuse rather than drop it silently | not implemented | not implemented | not implemented | not implemented | not implemented |

\* CHIPS partitions a cookie by the top-level site that embedded it, so the
same third-party cookie doesn't leak across unrelated sites; Firefox
container identity scopes a cookie to the container tab (`userContextId`)
that set it. Both isolate cookies that would otherwise collide.

rookie-cookies is the only one of the six that tracks CHIPS partition and
Firefox container identity all the way through to a send-ready cookie header
— the other five never read those columns at all. Four of the five
alternatives don't reach Chrome's v20 App-Bound Encryption at all — the
default since Chrome 127, and the only form some Chrome 133+ installs will
emit — and where they do touch a platform keystore, it's typically a per-call
shell-out to `security` / `secret-tool` / `kwallet-query` with no timeout or
cancellation and no distinction between "not found" and "access denied."
rookie-cookies ships one native Rust binary with deadline- and
cancellation-supervised key retrieval built in for every platform — no
optional native add-ons to discover after a crash, and no interpreter startup
or per-row subprocess cost standing between you and the cookie jar.

It's also the only project here that spans Python, JavaScript, and Rust from
one shared, tested codebase. pycookiecheat (Python) and get-cookie /
chrome-cookies-secure (Node) cover overlapping ground, but each is its own
independent implementation with its own test suite and its own release
cadence. If your stack touches more than one of these languages,
rookie-cookies means one codebase to evaluate and keep current instead of
several.

## Platforms and browsers

| Browser | Linux | macOS | Windows |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 360 Browser | — | — | ✓ |
| 360X Browser | — | — | ✓ |
| Arc | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Avast Secure Browser | — | — | ✓ |
| Brave | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Browser from Vought | — | — | ✓ |

| Safari | — | ✓ | — |
| Sogou Explorer | — | — | ✓ |
| Vivaldi | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Yandex | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Zen | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

That table is the full registry. `supported_browsers()` is the live
registration list for the running OS, so it returns the subset above whose
platform column is checked. Fifteen of the 25 have a named compatibility
helper (`chrome()`, `firefox()`, `safari()`, …); the other ten — Avast,
Browser from Vought, Cốc Cốc, DC Browser, DuckDuckGo, QQ Browser, Sogou
Explorer, 360, 360X, Yandex — are reachable through `read`/`jar`, the
report/profile APIs, and CLI report mode, but have no named `coccoc()`-style
function. `*_based` / `any_browser` still exist in 0.6 and are deprecated for
0.7.

### Cookie crypto (what `v10` / `v20` mean)

Chromium stores a prefix on each encrypted value. The names below are the
registry **decryption tiers** (`declared_decryption_tiers`), not marketing
labels.

| Tier | Where | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **legacy DPAPI** | Windows Chromium | Oldest Windows Chromium cookies: current-user DPAPI, no App-Bound wrapping. Still declared for every Windows Chromium browser in the registry. |
| **`v10`** | Windows, macOS, Linux Chromium | AES-GCM (Windows) or AES-CBC (Unix) values prefixed `v10`. Windows unwraps the AES key from `Local State` with DPAPI. macOS uses Keychain; Linux uses the OS crypt (often paired with `v11`). |
| **`v11`** | Linux Chromium | Same family as `v10`, prefixed `v11`, typically Secret Service / KWallet. |
| **App-Bound `v20`** | Windows Chrome-family | Chrome 127+ App-Bound Encryption (`APPB` key in `Local State`, values prefixed `v20`). Needs the default `appbound` feature. The unprivileged COM-injection path targets Chrome 127+; the elevated DPAPI/CNG fallback covers the 127-era formats and the flag-3 form introduced in Chrome 133+. Hosted canaries: Chrome, Edge, Brave. Also declared for Cốc Cốc and Avast. |
| **(none)** | Gecko, Safari, IE | Firefox / LibreWolf / Zen / Cachy: plaintext `cookies.sqlite` plus session JSON. Safari: `Cookies.binarycookies` (Full Disk Access). IE: ESE WebCache — functions exist in 0.6 and are deprecated. |

Windows Chromium at a glance:

| Windows browser | legacy DPAPI | `v10` | App-Bound `v20` |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Chrome, Edge, Brave | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cốc Cốc, Avast | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (library; not in the hosted canary matrix) |
| Arc, Chromium, Opera, Opera GX, Vivaldi, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, Octo, … | ✓ | ✓ | — |

A green **legacy DPAPI `v10`** extraction does **not** mean `v20` works. `v20`
may need elevation or a live host process; this project does not implement
Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC). Coverage details:
[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).

Linux Chromium is `v10` + `v11` (libsecret / KWallet). Most macOS Chromium
registrations declare Keychain-backed `v10`; macOS Cốc Cốc declares no
encrypted tier and can emit only plaintext rows. Gecko uses the same
sqlite/session layout on all three OSes.

## Install

| Language | Requirement | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | CPython ≥ 3.11 | `pip install rookie-cookies` |
| Node.js | Node ≥ 22 | `npm install rookie-cookies` |
| Rust | Rust ≥ 1.88, edition 2021 | `cargo add rookie-cookies` |
| CLI | same repo / release binaries | `rookie-cookies --help` |

**Windows App-Bound security note:** the recommended job APIs default to
unprivileged reflective COM injection into a spawned browser process when they
encounter `v20` cookies. Endpoint security products can flag that behavior.
Set `AppBoundPolicy::Disabled` in Rust, `app_bound="disabled"` in Python,
`appBound: "disabled"` in Node, or `--app-bound disabled` in the CLI to opt
out; App-Bound rows will then be omitted and reported as unavailable.

## Recommended usage (0.6 series)

Pass a **profile** to select one discovered profile; omit it to match the old
first-profile, legacy-compatible helpers.

**Session cookies are a separate question in the current API.** Ask for them
with `include_session` (`includeSession` in Node, `--include-session` on the
CLI). Naming a profile no longer implies them, and the change is quiet: a
Gecko `jar(profile="Default")` returns a smaller jar than it did in earlier
0.6 prereleases, with no error. Chromium registrations declare no separate
session source, so selecting a Chrome profile never recovered session state
held only in browser memory.

`read` never URL-filters the snapshot. The **send view** — `send_view` in Rust
and Python, `sendView` in Node, `send-view` on the CLI — is the one operation
that decides which stored rows a browsing context may send, and `header`
renders that same selection as a `Cookie` request-header string rather than
matching again. Rust passes `&SendContext`; Python and Node also accept a bare
URL as convenience syntax for the conservative default context. A bare URL is
not enough once the snapshot contains a partitioned or container-scoped
cookie, so those calls fail with the missing selectors
(`incomplete_send_context`, whose `required` names them) instead of merging
isolation boundaries. There is no top-level binding `header()` or `sendView()`,
and no crate-root Rust `get` / `report`.

`jar` is the warning-discarding **compatibility** projection over the same
`read` job, not the send path. Python returns `http.cookiejar.CookieJar`; Node
returns `CookieObject[]`; Rust returns `Vec<Cookie>`; the CLI's `--format
json|netscape` is the same shape. None of those has a field for a CHIPS
partition key, a Firefox `partitionKey` tuple, or container identity, so all
of them **fail closed** on an isolated snapshot with `isolation_loss_refused`
rather than turning context-scoped credentials into unscoped ones. Accepting
that loss is an explicit, named opt-in — `IsolationLoss::Allow` through
`jar_with`/`into_jar_with` in Rust, `allow_isolation_loss=True` in Python,
`allowIsolationLoss: true` in Node, `--allow-isolation-loss` on the CLI — and
the opted-in output is byte-for-byte what these produced in 0.6. A snapshot
with no isolated rows is unaffected. The infallible inventory accessors
(Rust `cookies()`, Python `as_list()`, Node's `cookies` getter) are unchanged:
they are for looking at raw rows, and never promised send-safety.

### Python

```python
import rookie_cookies as cookies

# Gecko session import — profile selection and session policy are independent
snapshot = cookies.read(
    browser="firefox", profile="default-release", include_session=True
)

# A browsing context in; the cookies it selects, the header, and a count of
# what was left out and why.
view = snapshot.send_view(
    "https://app.example.com/",
    top_level_site="https://example.com",
)
print(view["header"], view["omitted"]["partition"])

# `as_list()` is the inventory projection. `as_jar()` / `jar(...)` are
# compatibility only: they refuse an isolated snapshot unless
# `allow_isolation_loss=True` names the loss.
rows = cookies.read(browser="chrome", profile="Work").as_list()
```

### Node.js

```javascript
import { read } from "rookie-cookies";

// Gecko session import — profile selection and session policy are independent
const snapshot = await read({
  browser: "firefox",
  profile: "default-release",
  includeSession: true,
});

// A browsing context in; the cookies it selects, the header, and a count of
// what was left out and why.
const view = snapshot.sendView({
  url: "https://app.example.com/",
  topLevelSite: "https://example.com",
});
console.log(view.header, view.omitted.partition);

// `snapshot.cookies` is the inventory projection. The flat jar job is
// compatibility only: it cannot carry a partition or a container, so it
// refuses an isolated snapshot unless `allowIsolationLoss: true` names the loss.
console.log(snapshot.cookies.length);
```

Extraction is async. Always `await`.

### Rust

```rust
use rookie_cookies::{read, ReadRequest, SendContext};

fn main() -> rookie_cookies::Result<()> {
    // Gecko session import — profile selection and session policy are independent
    let snapshot = read(
        ReadRequest::browser("firefox")
            .profile("default-release")
            .include_session(),
    )?;

    // A browsing context in; the cookies it selects, the header, and a count
    // of what was left out and why.
    let view = snapshot.send_view(
        &SendContext::url("https://app.example.com/")
            .top_level_site("https://example.com"),
    )?;
    println!("{} {}", view.header(), view.omitted().partition());

    // `cookies()` is the inventory projection. `jar()`/`into_jar()` are
    // compatibility only: they refuse an isolated snapshot unless
    // `jar_with(IsolationLoss::Allow)` names the loss.
    println!("{} cookies", snapshot.cookies().len());
    Ok(())
}
```

### CLI

```console
rookie-cookies read --browser firefox --profile default-release --include-session
rookie-cookies header --url https://example.com/ --browser chrome
rookie-cookies send-view --url https://example.com/ --top-level-site https://example.com --browser chrome
rookie-cookies from-path /path/to/cookies.sqlite
rookie-cookies from-path /path/to/Cookies --browser-id chrome
rookie-cookies report --browser chrome
rookie-cookies report
rookie-cookies browsers
rookie-cookies profiles firefox
```

Chromium credential flags (`--browser-id`, `--local-state-path`,
`--plaintext-only`) are mutually exclusive on `from-path`. The CLI is job
subcommands only: `header` takes `--url` rather than a positional, `report`
takes an optional `--browser` (omitting it means the aggregate report), and
the old top-level `--path` / `--browser` flags are gone.

`header` and `send-view` share one flat send selector: `--url`,
`--top-level-site`, `--resource`, `--method`, `--user-context-id`,
`--private-browsing-id`, `--ancestor-chain same-site|cross-site`,
`--first-party-domain`, `--gecko-view-session-context-id`,
`--origin-attributes`, and `--now <epoch seconds>`. `send-view` prints one
JSON object — `cookies` (the selected records, in `--format detailed`
serialization), `header` (what `header` would print), and `omitted` (every
omission reason with its count, zeroes included). `read` and `from-path`
gain `--allow-isolation-loss`: `--format json` and `--format netscape` have
no column for a partition key or a container identity, so a snapshot holding
isolated cookies is refused (`isolation_loss_refused`) until that named
opt-in says the loss is acceptable. `--format detailed` carries the context
and never needs it. `from-path --domains` stays a flat, compatibility-only
route and takes none of the selector surface, but it is not a way around the
refusal: its one `extract_from_path` acquisition keeps detailed rows through
the policy check, then projects those same rows to the flat result. A browser
update cannot interleave separate policy and output reads, and successful
output remains exactly what the flat job has always produced.

Runtime failures from the typed `rookie_cookies::Error` hierarchy are written
to stderr as one JSON object. Every such object carries `code` and `message`;
a given `code` may add further documented fields, and the two send-selection
codes — `incomplete_send_context` and `isolation_loss_refused` — add
`required`, the list of selector tokens the call is missing. Consumers must
ignore keys they do not recognize rather than reject them. Branch on the
stable `code`; `message` is a human diagnostic and may change. Clap usage
errors and wrapped or non-library failures retain their normal human
`Display` output and are not promised to be JSON. Failed jobs do not write a
partial cookie result to stdout.

### Migrating to 0.7

Nothing is renamed, and every 0.6 call site still compiles: `read`, `header`,
`jar` / `as_jar`, the inventory accessors, and every named helper keep their
names, and the opt-in arrives as a defaulted keyword or a superset options
type rather than a changed argument list. Three behaviors change, and each
language guide has the full table:
[python](bindings/python/README.md#migrating-to-07) ·
[javascript](bindings/node/README.md#migrating-to-07) ·
[rust](rookie-rs/README.md#migrating-to-07).

1. **`jar` fails closed.** Only against a snapshot that holds an isolated
   cookie, and only until you say which you meant: a browsing context (the
   send view) or a flat list you have accepted the loss on (the opt-in above).
2. **Send selection matches the full partition identity.** Chromium's
   ancestor-chain bit, Firefox's partition port and foreign-ancestor bit, and
   every Firefox `OriginAttributes` equality field now separate rows that
   0.6 merged. A row carrying an attribute this build does not recognize is
   omitted until named exactly. Supply the selectors the error's `required`
   list names.
3. **Same-site includes subdomains.** A request to `www.example.com` under
   `top_level_site=https://example.com` is same-site where 0.6 called it
   cross-site. The rule only widens; sibling subdomains stay cross-site.

Coming from the legacy named helpers? Each language guide also documents the
compatibility surface and its migration to the recommended API:
[python](bindings/python/README.md) · [javascript](bindings/node/README.md) · [rust](rookie-rs/README.md).

## Security

Extracted cookies are credentials. Do not log them, commit them, or paste them
into issues. Use only profiles and accounts you are allowed to access.

On Windows, App-Bound `v20` may need elevated or host-process access.
This project does not implement Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) and
does not export browser private keys. A decrypted cookie is not always enough
to replay a protected Chrome session.
