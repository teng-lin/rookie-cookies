`rookie-cookies` provides cross-platform browser cookie extraction and
decryption for 25 local browsers on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It covers Chrome
cookie extraction — including Chrome App-Bound Encryption (ABE) `v20` and
`IElevator2` — plus Edge, Brave, Chromium, Firefox cookie extraction, Safari
cookie extraction, and 19 more browsers.

A single native Rust core powers Rust, Python, Node.js, and CLI APIs. It is
exercised by 34 real-browser CI combinations, including a live Windows
App-Bound `v20` canary against Chrome, Edge, and Brave, so every language shares
the same tested decryption logic. See [How rookie-cookies
compares](#how-rookie-cookies-compares) for how that holds up against the rest
of the ecosystem.

## Install

| Language | Requirement | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | CPython ≥ 3.11 | `pip install rookie-cookies` |
| Node.js | Node ≥ 22 | `npm install rookie-cookies` |
| Rust | Rust ≥ 1.88, edition 2021 | `cargo add rookie-cookies` |
| CLI | same repo / release binaries | `rookie-cookies --help` |

**Windows App-Bound security note:** the recommended job APIs default to
unprivileged reflective COM injection into a spawned browser process when they
encounter `v20` cookies. Endpoint security products can flag that behavior.
Set `AppBoundPolicy::Disabled` in Rust, `app_bound="disabled"` in Python,
`appBound: "disabled"` in Node, or `--app-bound disabled` in the CLI to opt
out; App-Bound rows will then be omitted and reported as unavailable.

This project started as a maintained fork of
[`thewh1teagle/rookie`](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/rookie), which is
archived. We still ship that project's public call shapes (`chrome()`,
`firefox()`, `load()`, and friends) so existing consumers keep working.

That compatibility is a **bridge, not a promise**. New work should use the 0.6
job API (`read` / `jar`). Later releases will break the old surface as we
add capabilities and clean up the design. Plan on migrating; do not take the
legacy helpers as frozen forever.

## What is different from upstream rookie

We keep the old names working while the library grows past a bag of
per-browser functions:

- One recommended job (`read` / `jar`) instead of “call `chrome()` and hope”.
- Profile queries so profile and Gecko session-source selection are explicit.
- Structured reports, explicit-path builders, timeouts, and cancellation.
- Chromium formats through **legacy DPAPI**, **`v10` / `v11`**, and **App-Bound
  `v20`** where the host and browser allow it.
- Shared tests across Rust, Python, Node, and the CLI.

Those additions are why the old API will eventually go away rather than stay
the documented default.

## How rookie-cookies compares

Cookie extraction has a lot of open-source options. Most are single-language
scripts that shell out to a system credential tool per lookup, and most stop
at Chrome's legacy `v10`/DPAPI cookies. Checked against source on 2026-08-22:

| | **rookie-cookies** | pycookiecheat | get-cookie | chrome-cookies-secure | yt-dlp `cookies.py` | HackBrowserData |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Browsers | 25, incl. Safari, IE, Zen, Cachy, Octo, Cốc Cốc, Yandex, Arc, DuckDuckGo, Avast, QQ, 360, Sogou, DC Browser | Chrome family + Firefox only | 11 Chromium/Gecko + Safari | Chrome only | 7 Chromium forks + Firefox + Safari | 19, incl. Safari, QQ, 360, Sogou, DC Browser; no IE, Zen, Cachy, Octo, LibreWolf |
| Bindings | Rust, Python, Node, CLI | Python only | Node/TS only | Node only | Python only, and not a published library surface | Go only, CLI binary — not designed for embedding |
| Chrome/Edge/Brave **v20 App-Bound** (127+, incl. 133+ flag-3) | ✓ COM injection + elevated DPAPI/CNG fallback | ✗ — no Windows Chromium support at all | ✗ | ✗ — broke outright on Chrome 130/131 | ✗ | partial — reflective-injection route; 133+ flag-3 elevated fallback unconfirmed |
| Windows DPAPI | built in | n/a | requires an optional npm package, throws if absent | requires a manual `optionalDependencies` install | built in | built in |
| Linux KWallet-corruption empty-key fallback | ✓ | ✗ | not implemented | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Output | structured report with typed issue taxonomy, jar, or list | dict / dataclass list | cookie objects / CLI formats | cookiejar / curl / header formats | `CookieJar`; failed rows silently dropped | CSV/JSON/db file dump via CLI; no structured issue taxonomy |
| Testing rigor | 34 real-browser CI combinations, 3 fuzz targets, scheduled OSV scans | ~623 lines of tests, no fuzzing, no browser-matrix CI | 82 test files, no fuzzing, no browser-matrix CI | no fuzzing or hardening signal observed | unit tests folded into yt-dlp's larger suite, no browser-matrix CI | CI + codecov, no fuzzing or real-browser E2E |
| CHIPS partition / Firefox container identity* | ✓ captured and preserved through `read()`/`DetailedCookie`; only the `jar()`/`cookies()` compatibility projection discards it | not implemented | not implemented | not implemented | not implemented | not implemented |

\* CHIPS partitions a cookie by the top-level site that embedded it, so the
same third-party cookie doesn't leak across unrelated sites; Firefox
container identity scopes a cookie to the container tab (`userContextId`)
that set it. Both isolate cookies that would otherwise collide.

rookie-cookies is the only one of the six that tracks CHIPS partition and
Firefox container identity all the way through to a send-ready cookie header
— the other five never read those columns at all. Four of the five
alternatives don't reach Chrome's v20 App-Bound Encryption at all — the
default since Chrome 127, and the only form some Chrome 133+ installs will
emit — and where they do touch a platform keystore, it's typically a per-call
shell-out to `security` / `secret-tool` / `kwallet-query` with no timeout or
cancellation and no distinction between "not found" and "access denied."
rookie-cookies ships one native Rust binary with deadline- and
cancellation-supervised key retrieval built in for every platform — no
optional native add-ons to discover after a crash, and no interpreter startup
or per-row subprocess cost standing between you and the cookie jar.

It's also the only project here that spans Python, JavaScript, and Rust from
one shared, tested codebase. pycookiecheat (Python) and get-cookie /
chrome-cookies-secure (Node) cover overlapping ground, but each is its own
independent implementation with its own test suite and its own release
cadence. If your stack touches more than one of these languages,
rookie-cookies means one codebase to evaluate and keep current instead of
several.

## Platforms and browsers

| Browser | Linux | macOS | Windows |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 360 Browser | — | — | ✓ |
| 360X Browser | — | — | ✓ |
| Arc | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Avast Secure Browser | — | — | ✓ |
| Brave | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Browser from Vought | — | — | ✓ |

| Yandex | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Zen | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

That table is the full registry. `supported_browsers()` is the live
registration list for the running OS, so it returns the subset above whose
platform column is checked. Fifteen of the 25 have a named compatibility
helper (`chrome()`, `firefox()`, `safari()`, …); the other ten — Avast,
Browser from Vought, Cốc Cốc, DC Browser, DuckDuckGo, QQ Browser, Sogou
Explorer, 360, 360X, Yandex — are reachable through `read`/`jar`, the
report/profile APIs, and CLI report mode, but have no named `coccoc()`-style
function. `*_based` / `any_browser` still exist in 0.6 and are deprecated for
0.7.

### Cookie crypto (what `v10` / `v20` mean)

Chromium stores a prefix on each encrypted value. The names below are the
registry **decryption tiers** (`declared_decryption_tiers`), not marketing
labels.

| Tier | Where | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **legacy DPAPI** | Windows Chromium | Oldest Windows Chromium cookies: current-user DPAPI, no App-Bound wrapping. Still declared for every Windows Chromium browser in the registry. |
| **`v10`** | Windows, macOS, Linux Chromium | AES-GCM (Windows) or AES-CBC (Unix) values prefixed `v10`. Windows unwraps the AES key from `Local State` with DPAPI. macOS uses Keychain; Linux uses the OS crypt (often paired with `v11`). |
| **`v11`** | Linux Chromium | Same family as `v10`, prefixed `v11`, typically Secret Service / KWallet. |
| **App-Bound `v20`** | Windows Chrome-family | Chrome 127+ App-Bound Encryption (`APPB` key in `Local State`, values prefixed `v20`). Needs the default `appbound` feature. The unprivileged COM-injection path targets Chrome 127+; the elevated DPAPI/CNG fallback covers the 127-era formats and the flag-3 form introduced in Chrome 133+. Hosted canaries: Chrome, Edge, Brave. Also declared for Cốc Cốc and Avast. |
| **(none)** | Gecko, Safari, IE | Firefox / LibreWolf / Zen / Cachy: plaintext `cookies.sqlite` plus session JSON. Safari: `Cookies.binarycookies` (Full Disk Access). IE: ESE WebCache — functions exist in 0.6 and are deprecated. |

Windows Chromium at a glance:

| Windows browser | legacy DPAPI | `v10` | App-Bound `v20` |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Chrome, Edge, Brave | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cốc Cốc, Avast | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (library; not in the hosted canary matrix) |
| Arc, Chromium, Opera, Opera GX, Vivaldi, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, Octo, … | ✓ | ✓ | — |

A green **legacy DPAPI `v10`** extraction does **not** mean `v20` works. `v20`
may need elevation or a live host process; this project does not implement
Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC). Coverage details:
[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).

Linux Chromium is `v10` + `v11` (libsecret / KWallet). Most macOS Chromium
registrations declare Keychain-backed `v10`; macOS Cốc Cốc declares no
encrypted tier and can emit only plaintext rows. Gecko uses the same
sqlite/session layout on all three OSes.

## Recommended usage (0.6 series)

Pass a **profile** to select one discovered profile; omit it to match the old
first-profile, legacy-compatible helpers.

**Session cookies are a separate question in the current API.** Ask for them
with `include_session` (`includeSession` in Node, `--include-session` on the
CLI). Naming a profile no longer implies them, and the change is quiet: a
Gecko `jar(profile="Default")` returns a smaller jar than it did in earlier
0.6 prereleases, with no error. Chromium registrations declare no separate
session source, so selecting a Chrome profile never recovered session state
held only in browser memory.

`read` never URL-filters the snapshot; `ReadResult.header` is a **view** over a
send context. Rust passes `&SendContext`; Python and Node also accept a bare URL
as convenience syntax for the conservative default context. A bare URL is not
enough once the snapshot contains a partitioned or container-scoped cookie, so
those calls fail with the missing selectors instead of merging isolation
boundaries. There is no top-level binding `header()`, and no crate-root Rust
`get` / `report`.

`jar` is warning-discarding projection sugar over the same `read` job. Python
returns `http.cookiejar.CookieJar`; Node returns `CookieObject[]`; Rust returns
`Vec<Cookie>`. Use `read` when warnings or partition/container context matter.

### Python

```python
import rookie_cookies as cookies

session_jar = cookies.jar(
    browser="firefox", profile="default-release", include_session=True
)
rows = cookies.read(browser="chrome", profile="Work").as_list()

# Filter during extraction and return a list of cookie dictionaries.
filtered_rows = cookies.extract(
    browser="chrome", profile="Work", domains=["example.com"]
)
```

### Node.js

```javascript
import { jar, read } from "rookie-cookies";

const sessionCookies = await jar({
  browser: "firefox",
  profile: "default-release",
  includeSession: true,
});

const snapshot = await read({
  browser: "chrome",
  profile: "Work",
});
console.log(sessionCookies, snapshot.header("https://example.com/"));
```

Extraction is async. Always `await`.

### Rust

```rust
use rookie_cookies::{jar, read, ReadRequest, SendContext};

fn main() -> rookie_cookies::Result<()> {
    let session_cookies = jar(
        ReadRequest::browser("firefox")
            .profile("default-release")
            .include_session(),
    )?;
    let snapshot = read(
        ReadRequest::browser("chrome").profile("Work"),
    )?;
    println!("{} cookies", session_cookies.len());
    println!("{}", snapshot.header(&SendContext::url("https://example.com/"))?);
    Ok(())
}
```

### CLI

```console
rookie-cookies read --browser firefox --profile default-release --include-session
rookie-cookies header --url https://example.com/ --browser chrome
rookie-cookies from-path /path/to/cookies.sqlite
rookie-cookies from-path /path/to/Cookies --browser-id chrome
rookie-cookies report --browser chrome
rookie-cookies report
rookie-cookies browsers
rookie-cookies profiles firefox
```

Chromium credential flags (`--browser-id`, `--local-state-path`,
`--plaintext-only`) are mutually exclusive on `from-path`. The CLI is job
subcommands only: `header` takes `--url` rather than a positional, `report`
takes an optional `--browser` (omitting it means the aggregate report), and
the old top-level `--path` / `--browser` flags are gone.

Runtime failures from the typed `rookie_cookies::Error` hierarchy are written
to stderr as one JSON object with exactly `code` and `message` fields. Branch
on the stable `code`; `message` is a human diagnostic and may change. Clap
usage errors and wrapped or non-library failures retain their normal human
`Display` output and are not promised to be JSON. Failed jobs do not write a
partial cookie result to stdout.

Coming from the legacy named helpers? Each language guide documents the
compatibility surface and its migration to the recommended 0.6 API:

## Security

Extracted cookies are credentials. Do not log them, commit them, or paste them
into issues. Use only profiles and accounts you are allowed to access.

On Windows, App-Bound `v20` may need elevated or host-process access.
This project does not implement Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) and
does not export browser private keys. A decrypted cookie is not always enough
to replay a protected Chrome session.
