# rookie-cookies (Node.js)

Extract cookies from local browsers on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

This file is the **JavaScript guide** (npm landing page and repo tutorial).
Rust stays in [`rookie-rs/README.md`](https://github.com/teng-lin/rookie-cookies/blob/main/rookie-rs/README.md).
The recommended entry is `read`, then `sendView` for anything you intend
to send
([ADR 0004](https://github.com/teng-lin/rookie-cookies/blob/main/docs/adr/0004-read-is-the-recommended-entry.md),
[ADR 0006](https://github.com/teng-lin/rookie-cookies/blob/main/docs/adr/0006-isolation-safe-send-selection-and-explicit-isolation-loss.md)).
Package metadata and `version()` identify the installed build.

**Node.js ≥ 22** (tested 22, 24, 26). Every extraction export returns a
**Promise** — always `await`. `version()` is synchronous.

```console
npm install rookie-cookies
```

> **Windows App-Bound security note:** jobs default to unprivileged reflective
> injection into a spawned browser process, which endpoint security can flag.
> Pass `appBound: "disabled"` to `read`, `fromPath`, or report jobs to perform
> no App-Bound process work; `v20` rows will then be omitted with a warning.

## Recommended usage (0.6 series)

```js
import { read } from "rookie-cookies";

// Gecko session import — profile selection and session policy are independent
const snapshot = await read({
  browser: "firefox",
  profile: "default-release",
  includeSession: true,
});
console.log(snapshot.warnings);

// A browsing context in; the cookies it selects, the header they render to,
// and a count of what was left out and why.
const view = snapshot.sendView({
  url: "https://app.example.com/",
  topLevelSite: "https://example.com",
});
console.log(view.header, view.omitted.partition);

// `snapshot.cookies` is the inventory projection. The flat jar job is
// compatibility only: it refuses an isolated snapshot unless
// `allowIsolationLoss: true` names the loss.
console.log(snapshot.cookies.length);
```

Pass `profile` to select one discovered profile. `read` never URL-filters.
There is **no** top-level `header()` or `sendView()` — call them on the
snapshot.

`jar(options)` is `read(options).cookies` projection sugar: it returns a flat
`CookieObject[]`, discards warnings, and has no cell that could carry partition
or container identity. Node has no standard-library cookie-jar class; pass the
returned records to the HTTP client or cookie-store library you use. Choose
`read` when you need diagnostics, isolation-aware records, or the built-in send
view.

**Since 0.7, `jar` fails closed** rather than dropping that identity silently.
A snapshot holding any CHIPS-partitioned or
Firefox-container cookie rejects with
`rookieCode === "isolation_loss_refused"` rather than flattening scoped
credentials into a list that looks like it belongs everywhere. Either name a
browsing context with `read(...).sendView(...)`, or pass
`allowIsolationLoss: true` to say a flat list is acceptable anyway:

```js
import { jar } from "rookie-cookies";

const flat = await jar({ browser: "firefox", allowIsolationLoss: true });
```

`allowIsolationLoss` lives on `JarOptions` only, never on `ReadOptions` — a
`read` call has nothing to lose, so accepting the flag there would mean
silently ignoring it. Passing it to `read` or `fromPath` rejects by name
before any I/O, in the type system and at run time. The opt-in changes only
whether a call can fail; a
successful `jar({ ..., allowIsolationLoss: true })` is byte-for-byte
`read({ ... }).cookies`. A snapshot with no isolated rows resolves either way,
exactly as before.

- No-profile `await read({ browser: "chrome" })` matches legacy `chrome()`
  (persistent / legacy-eligible cookies).
- `includeSession: true` also acquires a Gecko-family profile's separately
  declared session JSON source. **Migration trap:** in earlier 0.6 prereleases,
  naming a Gecko `profile` alone imported session cookies; it no longer does —
  pass `includeSession: true` explicitly. This fails *silently*: a smaller
  snapshot, no error. Chromium registrations declare no separate session
  source and cannot recover session state that exists only in browser memory,
  so `includeSession` is a no-op there.
- `select` accepts only `"legacy_first"` (the default) on `read`; a caller
  cannot ask for every profile here (`report`/`browserReport` do that). Any
  other value, including `"all"`, rejects with `kind === "request"`,
  `rookieCode === "conflicting_profile_selection"`, before any I/O runs.

`snapshot.warnings` items carry a stable `code`: `decrypt_failed`,
`row_read_failed`, `invalid_octets`, `malformed_host_identity` (a row's host
could not be parsed as a valid domain), `unparsable_partition_key` (a
Firefox `partitionKey` value did not match the expected shape), and
`unknown_ancestor_chain` (a partitioned Chromium row whose
`has_cross_site_ancestor` bit the store did not record). The last two count
rows the snapshot *keeps* and no send context can select, which is why the
projected `message` reads `N rows affected (code)` rather than "skipped".
Branch on `code`, not `message`, which is diagnostic text only.

Named helpers (`chrome()`, `brave()`, `load()`) still work and also return
Promises. They are the compatibility bridge from
[`thewh1teagle/rookie`](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/rookie) / `@rookie-rs/api`
and will break in a later major version. Prefer `read` plus `sendView` for
new code.

## Isolation: detailed cookies and the send view

`snapshot.cookies` is the legacy eight-field projection: it discards each
cookie's partition/container identity, so rows differing only by partition or
container become indistinguishable, and a downstream jar keyed by domain,
path, and name keeps only one of them. (The crate itself maps one `Cookie`
per `DetailedCookie`, with no dedupe — the collision happens downstream, in
whatever jar or store the caller feeds the array into.) `snapshot.detailedCookies`
keeps that identity instead: the same eight `Cookie` fields plus a `context`
object (`topFrameSiteKey`, `hasCrossSiteAncestor`, `sourceScheme`,
`sourcePort`, `isPersistent`, `originAttributes`, `userContextId`,
`partitionKey`, `privateBrowsingId`; every field nullable, since cookie
schemas vary by browser).

`ReadResult.sendView` is **the** send-selection operation. It takes either a
bare URL string (sugar for `{ url }`, matching the conservative
`Subresource`/`Safe` defaults) or a `SendContextObject`, and returns the
selected records, the rendered header, and a count of what was left out:

```js
import { read } from "rookie-cookies";

const snapshot = await read({ browser: "chrome", profile: "Default" });
const view = snapshot.sendView({
  url: "https://example.com/",
  topLevelSite: "https://example.com",
  resource: "navigation",
  method: "safe",
});
console.log(view.header, view.cookies.length, view.omitted.partition);
```

`ReadResult.header(context)` is exactly `sendView(context).header`; it renders
from the same selection rather than repeating the match, so the two can never
disagree. Use `header` when a request-header string is all you need, and
`sendView` when the records or the reasons matter. An empty selection is a
legitimate answer, not an error — `omitted` is how you tell "this context has
no cookies" apart from "everything was excluded".

`view.omitted` always carries all seven reasons, zeroes included:
`expired`, `notApplicable` (the RFC 6265 domain/path/`Secure` rules),
`sameSite`, `partition`, `ancestorChainUnknown` (a partitioned Chromium row
whose store never recorded `has_cross_site_ancestor`), `unparsablePartitionKey`,
and `origin` (a container or origin-attribute mismatch). Each row is counted
once, under the first stage it failed.

### Selectors

Beyond `topLevelSite`, `userContextId`, and `privateBrowsingId`, a
`SendContextObject` carries four selectors added in 0.7:

- `ancestorChain: "same_site" | "cross_site"` — omit it and the chain is
  *derived*: same-site when the request site is within `topLevelSite`,
  cross-site otherwise. Set it to describe an `A → B → A` embed, whose request
  site and top-level site are equal even though an ancestor frame is
  cross-site. Both engines put this bit in the partition key, and it also
  makes the request cross-site for `SameSite=Lax`/`Strict`. Any other string
  rejects with `code === "InvalidArg"`.
- `firstPartyDomain` and `geckoViewSessionContextId` — the two remaining
  Firefox `OriginAttributes` equality fields. Once supplied, a row that does
  not carry the attribute is not a match.
- `originAttributes` — the verbatim stored Firefox suffix, and the only way to
  select an **opaque Firefox** row: one carrying an attribute name this build
  does not know, or a `partitionKey` it cannot parse. Such a row is omitted
  unless this selector equals its suffix byte-for-byte; it is never assumed to
  be the default context. Pass the value straight from
  `detailedCookies[i].context.originAttributes`; the comparison is byte
  equality against what the browser stored. It governs opaque rows only, so
  one future-Firefox row cannot collapse the rest of the snapshot. An
  unparsable Chromium key has no raw suffix to name and remains omitted from
  every send view.

A supplied selector that matches nothing omits rows; it never throws. Only a
*missing* one is an error.

A snapshot holding any CHIPS-partitioned or Firefox-container cookie rejects
with `rookieCode === "incomplete_send_context"` instead of silently merging
isolated cookies into one answer. Its `required` array names the missing
selectors, in a stable order: `top_level_site`, `user_context_id`,
`private_browsing_id`, `first_party_domain`,
`gecko_view_session_context_id`, `origin_attributes`. The same vocabulary
appears on `isolation_loss_refused`, so one handler covers both:

```js
import { read } from "rookie-cookies";

const snapshot = await read({ browser: "firefox" });
try {
  console.log(snapshot.header("https://example.com/"));
} catch (error) {
  if (error.rookieCode === "incomplete_send_context") {
    console.log("supply:", error.required);
  }
}
```

`required` is empty for every other code. `invalid_url`,
`invalid_top_level_site`, and `clock_unrepresentable` are the other
send-selection request faults; all of them throw synchronously, since the
snapshot is already loaded.

One shape to know: a rejection raised while *reading the argument* — an
`ancestorChain` that is not one of the two spellings, a `resource` or `method`
that is not one of theirs — carries only `code` (`"InvalidArg"`) and a
message. It never reached the core, so there is nothing for it to have
classified, and `kind`, `rookieCode`, and `required` are absent rather than
null. Every rejection from an `await`ed job carries the full set.

## Reports

Named helpers return a flat `CookieObject[]` from one source. Report APIs cover
every installation and profile and keep failures on the object (camelCase
fields).

```js
import { browserProfiles, browserReport, loadReport, supportedBrowsers } from "rookie-cookies";

for (const browser of await supportedBrowsers()) {
  console.log(browser.id, browser.displayName, browser.capabilities.availableDecryptionTiers);
}

const profiles = await browserProfiles("chrome");
if (profiles.length === 0) {
  // absent browser — not an exception
} else {
  // Pass an explicit profileId. `undefined` means every profile, so do not
  // use `profiles[0]?.profile.profileId` on an empty list.
  const report = await browserReport({
    browserId: "chrome",
    profileId: profiles[0].profile.profileId,
    domains: ["example.com"],
  });
  if (report.schemaVersion !== 1) throw new Error("unsupported report schema");
  console.log(report.status, report.summary.cookiesEmitted);
  for (const profile of report.profiles) {
    for (const source of profile.sources) {
      if (source.selected && source.status === "succeeded") {
        console.log(profile.profile.displayName, source.source.path, source.cookies.length);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Job-layer aliases:

```js
import { profiles, report } from "rookie-cookies";

const listed = await profiles("chrome");
if (listed.length === 0) {
  console.log("Chrome is not installed");
} else {
  // Never use optional chaining here: `undefined` means every profile.
  const viaJob = await report({
    browser: "chrome",
    profile: listed[0].profile.profileId,
  });
  console.log(viaJob.status);
}
```

A profile's cookie stream is its **selected** sources whose `status` is
`succeeded`, in listed order. A rejected candidate can still be `succeeded`,
so status-only filtering double-counts.

`schemaVersion` versions the DTO. `termination` (`completed`, `timed_out`,
`cancelled`, `resource_exhausted`) is independent of `status`. Counters are
ordinary numbers (never `BigInt`); overflow sets `countersSaturated`.

`supportedBrowsers()` is registration, not detection, and takes no execution
control — it is a static catalog lookup with no disk I/O. `profiles(id,
options?)` aliases `browserProfiles(id, options?)`; both take a
`ProfilesOptions` with only `timeoutMs` (listing does no App-Bound work).
`report({ browser, profile, ... })` is the job-layer name for
`browserReport(options)`; `loadReport(options?)` is the report-shaped
`load()`. `browserReport`, unlike `report`, takes its browser/profile
selection as `browserId`/`profileId` fields on one `BrowserReportOptions`
object rather than positional arguments.

These reject only on a bad request (`kind === "request"`): unknown browser, or
a `profileId` that browser did not yield. The stable `rookieCode` identifies
the exact request fault; the existing N-API `code` remains `InvalidArg` or
`GenericFailure`. `browserProfiles` also rejects when every installation root
failed enumeration. An absent registered browser resolves to `[]` or `status:
"no_sources"`. `report`/`browserReport`/`loadReport`'s `timeoutMs` can also
reject with `kind === "stopped"`; every other failure is `kind === "engine"`.

`report`, `browserReport`, and `loadReport` also take `appBound` (see
[App-Bound recovery](#app-bound-v20-recovery) below); `profiles` /
`browserProfiles` do not.

`report` also takes `select?: "legacy_first" | "all"` (default `"all"`).
Naming `profile` already narrows the report to it regardless of `select`;
`select: "all"` together with an explicit `profile` is the one contradiction
bindings must catch (Rust's `ReportScope` makes it unrepresentable, so this
is the runtime equivalent) — it rejects with `rookieCode ===
"conflicting_profile_selection"` before any I/O. `browserReport` has no
`select`: an absent `profileId` means every profile, exactly as it always
has.

`chrome()` stays default-first. `chromeProfiles()` / `chromeProfile()` add
activity-hint order and a grouped report; lossy `pathLossy` selectors need
`profileId`.

## Explicit paths

`extractFromPath` is the canonical flat, domain-filtered path-extract job
(matching Rust/Python `extract_from_path`):

```js
import { extractFromPath } from "rookie-cookies";

const firefox = await extractFromPath("/path/to/cookies.sqlite", {
  domains: ["example.com"],
});
const chrome = await extractFromPath("/path/to/Chrome/Default/Network/Cookies", {
  browserId: "chrome",
  domains: ["example.com"],
});
```

`options` bundles `domains`; at most one of `browserId`, `localStatePath`,
`plaintextOnly: true`; `timeoutMs`; `appBound` (same three values, same
`"injection_only"` default — see [App-Bound recovery](#app-bound-v20-recovery)).
Invalid option shapes reject with `TypeError` before I/O. Process shutdown is
not exposed. With no selector at all, the source is sniffed from its
signature and schema: a Chromium database found this way is plaintext-capable
only (an encrypted row is `missing_chromium_credentials`) — on Unix this is a
narrowing from earlier 0.6 prereleases, which probed every registered browser
identity in turn; on Windows it is a widening, since a fully plaintext
database used to reject with `missing_local_state_file` before attempting
extraction.

For isolation-carrying (detailed) path extraction, use
`fromPath(...).detailedCookies` instead — `fromPath`, like `read`, never
URL/domain-slices its snapshot:

```js
import { fromPath } from "rookie-cookies";

const snapshot = await fromPath({ path: "/path/to/Chrome/Default/Network/Cookies" });
for (const { cookie, context } of snapshot.detailedCookies) {
  console.log(cookie.name, context.topFrameSiteKey);
}
```

**`cookiesFromPath`, `chromiumCookiesFromPath`, and
`chromiumCookiesFromPathDetailed` are deprecated aliases** onto
`extractFromPath` (the first two) and `fromPath(...).detailedCookies` (the
third), kept until ≥ 0.7. `chromiumCookiesFromPathDetailed` additionally no
longer supports `domains`: passing a non-empty `domains` to it rejects rather
than silently ignoring it, since the seam it now routes through can't filter.
`anyBrowser()`, `chromiumBased*`, and flat `firefoxBased()` are likewise
deprecated onto `extractFromPath` until ≥ 0.7. `firefoxBasedDetailed()` stays
for container context.

```js
import { chromiumBasedDetailed } from "rookie-cookies";

const records = await chromiumBasedDetailed(
  "/path/to/Brave/Default/Network/Cookies",
  ["example.com"],
  "brave",
);
for (const { cookie, context } of records) {
  console.log(cookie.name, context.topFrameSiteKey);
}
```

## Timeouts and cancellation

`extractFromPath` (and its deprecated aliases `cookiesFromPath` /
`chromiumCookiesFromPath` / `chromiumCookiesFromPathDetailed`), every
single-browser export, and `read` / `fromPath` accept `timeoutMs` and/or a
`CancellationHandle`. `report` /
`browserReport` / `loadReport` accept `timeoutMs` (no `CancellationHandle` yet);
`profiles` / `browserProfiles` accept `timeoutMs` only. `supportedBrowsers()`
takes neither — it does no disk I/O.

```js
import { chrome, CancellationHandle } from "rookie-cookies";

const cancellation = new CancellationHandle();
const timer = setTimeout(() => cancellation.cancel(), 5000);

try {
  const cookies = await chrome(undefined, 30000, cancellation);
  console.log(cookies);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.stopReason === "timed_out") {
    console.log("timed out");
  } else if (error.stopReason === "cancelled") {
    console.log("cancelled");
  } else {
    throw error;
  }
} finally {
  clearTimeout(timer);
}
```

Native rejections expose stable `kind`, `rookieCode`, and `stopReason`
properties while retaining the N-API status in `code`. `kind` is one of
`"request"` (bad caller input — unknown browser, ambiguous profile, invalid
URL, conflicting selectors; `code` is `InvalidArg`), `"stopped"` (the request's
`timeoutMs` elapsed or a `CancellationHandle` fired; `code` is `Cancelled` for
a cancellation and `GenericFailure` for a timeout or resource-exhaustion
stop), `"source"` (a caller-correctable direct-path source or option was
invalid; `code` is `InvalidArg`), or `"engine"` (discovery, acquisition,
decryption, or operational source inspection failed; `code` is
`GenericFailure`). An I/O, SQLite, locked, or corrupt-file inspection failure
has `rookieCode === "source_inspection_failed"`; diagnostics remain
path-sanitized. Treat `kind` as an open string for forward compatibility —
`rookie_cookies::Error` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so a newer core release can
add a variant this binding folds into `"engine"` until it is given its own
bucket.
Current `stopReason` values are `timed_out`, `cancelled`, and
`resource_exhausted`; treat the property as an open string for forward
compatibility.
Ambiguous profile errors also carry opaque `profileIds`; direct-path errors
carry `sourceKind`, `targetOs`, and a `pathRedacted` flag. The two send-selection
codes — `incomplete_send_context` and `isolation_loss_refused` — additionally
carry `required: string[]`, drawn from one six-token vocabulary
(`top_level_site`, `user_context_id`, `private_browsing_id`,
`first_party_domain`, `gecko_view_session_context_id`, `origin_attributes`).
For the first it is the selectors the call did not receive; for the second,
the ones a `sendView`/`header` call would need for that snapshot. It is empty
on every other error.
Human-readable `message` text remains diagnostic only. A `ReadResult`
warning whose Rust `u64` count exceeds JavaScript's `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`
sets `countersSaturated: true` while clamping `count` (an IEEE-754 `number`,
never `BigInt`) to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`. Facade validation errors carry
the same fields with safe empty/null metadata; because they do not cross
N-API, their `code` is absent and `rookieCode` is `null`.

## App-Bound (v20) recovery

`read`, `fromPath`, `report`, `browserReport`, `loadReport`, and
`extractFromPath` all take an `appBound` option. It is a no-op outside
Windows — macOS and Linux Chrome use the Keychain and Secret Service, which
this policy has nothing to do with. An unrecognized string rejects with
`kind === "request"` before any I/O runs.

| Value | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `"injection_only"` (default) | Unprivileged reflective COM injection into a spawned browser process (Chrome 127+). |
| `"disabled"` | No injection, no spawned process, no process enumeration, no SYSTEM impersonation. v20 rows are skipped and counted as `decrypt_failed` warnings. |
| `"allow_elevated_fallback"` | Injection, then permits elevated SYSTEM impersonation as a fallback (Chrome 133+). Never a default. |

The default is `"injection_only"` because Chrome has written App-Bound (v20)
cookies on Windows since Chrome 127: on a current profile essentially every
row is v20, so a policy that refused to recover them would return an **empty**
list for the most common Windows case.

**It is not free of consequence.** Injection spawns a browser process and
writes into it, which endpoint security products can flag. On a managed
machine where that matters, pass `"disabled"` explicitly and expect v20 rows
to be omitted:

```js
import { read } from "rookie-cookies";

const snapshot = await read({
  browser: "chrome",
  profile: "Default",
  appBound: "disabled",
});
```

The deprecated v0.5.9 bridge (`chrome()`, `chromiumBased()`, ...) keeps its
`allow_elevated_fallback`-equivalent behavior unchanged.

`profiles` / `browserProfiles` / `supportedBrowsers` take no `appBound`:
listing does no App-Bound work.

## Netscape

```js
import { chrome, toNetscape } from "rookie-cookies";

const output = toNetscape(await chrome());
```

Tabs / CR / LF become `%09` / `%0D` / `%0A`. Same encoding as Rust, CLI, and
Python.

## 0.5.6 API

In the 0.5.6 line extraction was **synchronous**. There was no `read` /
`fromPath` job API. Node 18/20 were still supported. Upstream published
`@rookie-rs/api`.

```js historical
import { brave, chrome, load } from "rookie-cookies";

// Synchronous in 0.5.6 — returns CookieObject[] directly (do not copy for 0.6)
const cookies = brave();
const filtered = chrome(["example.com"]);
const all = load();
```

## Migrate 0.5.6 → 0.6.0

| Area | 0.5.6 / early 0.5.x | 0.6.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recommended entry | `chrome()` / `brave()` (sync) | `await read({ browser, profile })` |
| Async contract | Sync return values | **Every** extraction export is a Promise (since 0.5.8) |
| Node.js | 18 / 20 accepted | **≥ 22** (tested 22 / 24 / 26) |
| Gecko session cookies | Not a first-class policy | `read({ browser: geckoId, includeSession: true })`; add `profile` only to choose a non-default profile, and note that `profile` alone does not import session cookies |
| Path APIs | `firefoxBased`, `chromiumBased`, `anyBrowser` | `extractFromPath` (`cookiesFromPath` / `chromiumCookiesFromPath` / `chromiumCookiesFromPathDetailed` are deprecated aliases until ≥ 0.7) |
| Errors | Flat `Unknown` | `kind` is `request`/`stopped`/`source`/`engine`; `code` is `InvalidArg` for request/source, `Cancelled` for a stopped cancellation, else `GenericFailure` |
| Header view | Manual | `snapshot.header(url \| SendContext)` — **no** top-level `header()`; a partitioned/container snapshot needs a `SendContext`, not a bare URL |
| Cookie identity | Flat only | `snapshot.detailedCookies` adds CHIPS partition / Firefox container `context`; `snapshot.browserId` is now `string \| null` |
| Reports | Not in 0.5.6 | `report({ browser, profile, select })` / `browserReport({ browserId, profileId })` |
| App-Bound (v20) recovery | Always attempted, with elevated fallback | `appBound` defaults to `"injection_only"` on `read`/`report`/`browserReport`/`loadReport`/`fromPath` — unprivileged injection, no SYSTEM impersonation unless you pass `"allow_elevated_fallback"`; the deprecated bridge is unaffected |

1. Bump Node.js to 22+.
2. Add `await` (or `.then`) to every extraction call.
3. Prefer `read`; pass `includeSession: true` when a Gecko profile's session source is wanted.
4. Move explicit DB paths off `*Based` / `anyBrowser`.
5. Inspect `.status` / `.code` for `InvalidArg` vs `GenericFailure`.
6. Do not invent a top-level `header()`; pass a `SendContext` once any snapshot might hold isolated cookies.

## Migrating to 0.7

Nothing is renamed. `read`, `header`, `snapshot.cookies`,
`snapshot.detailedCookies`, `jar`, and every named helper keep their names.
What changes: `jar` can now fail, `header` splits contexts it used to merge,
and `sendView` is the new method that answers what `jar` was often being
misused for.

| Area | 0.6 | 0.7 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Send selection | `snapshot.header(url \| SendContextObject)` | `snapshot.sendView(...)` returns the selected records, the header, and `omitted`; `header` is `sendView(...).header` |
| `jar` | Always flattened | Rejects with `isolation_loss_refused` on an isolated snapshot; `allowIsolationLoss: true` is the opt-in |
| `jar` options | `ReadOptions` | `JarOptions` — every `ReadOptions` field plus `allowIsolationLoss`, which `read`/`fromPath` reject rather than ignore |
| Selectors | `topLevelSite`, `userContextId`, `privateBrowsingId` | plus `ancestorChain`, `firstPartyDomain`, `geckoViewSessionContextId`, `originAttributes` |
| `required` | Populated for `incomplete_send_context` | Also for `isolation_loss_refused`, from the same six-token vocabulary |
| Same-site | Literal host equality | A request host that is a subdomain of `topLevelSite`'s host is now same-site, so `SameSite=Lax`/`Strict` rows it used to withhold are selected. Sibling subdomains stay cross-site; IP literals still need an exact match |

1. Leave `read`, `snapshot.cookies`, and `snapshot.detailedCookies` alone —
   none of them changed. `cookies` is still the infallible *inventory*
   projection.
2. Audit each `jar(...)` call. Against an unpartitioned snapshot it behaves
   exactly as before. Against an isolated one, decide which you meant: a
   specific browsing context (`read(...).sendView(...)`) or a flat list you
   have accepted the loss on (`allowIsolationLoss: true`).
3. Handle `isolation_loss_refused` wherever you already handle
   `incomplete_send_context`; `error.required` reads the same on both.
4. A `header` call that used to merge a partitioned snapshot into one answer
   now splits it. Where you previously guessed a context, supply the
   selectors `required` names.
