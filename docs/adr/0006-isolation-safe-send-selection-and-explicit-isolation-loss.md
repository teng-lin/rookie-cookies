# ADR 0006: Isolation-safe send selection and explicit isolation loss

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-01
- Implemented in 0.7.0 (issue #331, PRs 0–6); the program record below tracks
  which change carried which decision
- Scope: the send-context selector shape, the single send-selection
  operation, and the jar/compatibility-projection loss policy across Rust,
  Python, Node, and the CLI
- Amends: ADR 0004 §1, §3, §5, and Consequences
- Does not amend: ADR 0001–0003 behavior, ADR 0005 (internal extraction
  vocabulary; untouched by this ADR), the public API baseline beyond the
  additions listed under Consequences, the report DTO and
  `schema/report-dto.schema.json`, or `rookie-rs/browser_registry.json`
- Program record: [isolation-safe send
  selection](../design/isolation-safe-send-selection.md) — engine encoding

  the PR plan

## Context

Issue #177 and PR #299 (ADR 0004 §3 and §5, amended in 0.6.0) already fixed
the primary defect in the original architecture-gap note: `header()` no
longer collapses the snapshot through the frozen eight-field `Cookie` before
matching. `ReadResult` retains `Vec<DetailedCookie>` natively, `header(&SendContext)`
demands a selector rather than silently merging observed partitions, and that
demand is typed (`RequestError::IncompleteSendContext`). Issue #331 is the
0.7 successor, scoped to the two gaps that survived #299 — both re-verified
against this tree rather than assumed from the issue text:

1. **The partition key `header()` matches on is incomplete.**
   `PartitionIdentity` (`rookie-rs/src/header_filter.rs:132-166`) reduces both
   engines' partition identity to `(scheme, host)`. Chromium's
   `has_cross_site_ancestor` bit is captured at decode time
   (`rookie-rs/src/browser/chromium_decoder.rs:143-149`) but never consulted
   by `isolation_matches` (`rookie-rs/src/read.rs:453-490`; the limitation is
   already disclosed in the `header` doc comment at `read.rs:296-304`). Two
   Chromium rows with the same top-level site and different ancestor-chain
   bits therefore both match one `SendContext`. The Firefox tuple parser
   (`site_from_firefox_partition_key`, `header_filter.rs:90-102`) reads only
   scheme and host and discards any trailing port or foreign-ancestor `f`
   field; the existing test
   `a_firefox_partition_tuple_with_extra_fields_still_matches` blesses that
   as current behavior, and this ADR retires it. Firefox origin-attribute
   parsing (`firefox_cookie_context`, `rookie-rs/src/browser/mozilla.rs:133-155`)
   recognizes only `userContextId`, `partitionKey`, and `privateBrowsingId`;
   `firstPartyDomain`, `geckoViewSessionContextId`, and any attribute name it
   does not recognize fall into a `_ => {}` arm and are retained on
   `CookieContext.origin_attributes` for inventory but behave like the
   default context during selection — a stored non-default value is
   indistinguishable from an unset one at the point `header()` matches.
2. **The compatibility jar is a silent lossy projection.** Rust `jar()`
   (`read.rs:559`, `read(request)?.into_cookies()`), Python
   `ReadResult.as_jar()` / free `jar()` (`bindings/python/rookie_cookies/__init__.py:204-208`,
   via `as_list()`), Node `jar` (`bindings/node/src/lib.rs:1846`, resolving
   `into_cookies()`), and the CLI's `--format json|netscape` all flatten to
   the eight-field compatibility shape unconditionally, with no error and no
   count. `http.cookiejar.CookieJar`, Netscape-format rows, and a flat
   `CookieObject[]`/`Cookie[]` all have no field their send-match consults
   for a Chromium CHIPS partition key, a Firefox `partitionKey` tuple, or
   Firefox container/private-browsing identity — `http.cookiejar.Cookie` in
   particular has a `rest` dict that could technically hold arbitrary data,
   but nothing in its send-match logic looks at it, so stashing isolation
   identity there would not change what gets sent. A successful jar call is
   therefore currently indistinguishable from one that dropped
   isolation-bound credentials into an unscoped bag.

`docs/architecture_api_gap_consolidated.md`, the document issue #331 names as
its Phase 0 target, was deleted by PR #333; the "header collapses through
`Cookie`" claim it recorded is already absent from the README and
`docs/architecture.md`. Phase 0 (this PR) therefore reduces to this ADR, the
program record, and a small number of residual prose corrections that
predate this ADR's decisions (stale `.cookies()` naming, ADR 0004 §3's own
"the consuming HTTP client owns send-match" claim — which this ADR's
Decision 2 supersedes — and one "merges" sentence in the Node README that
should say "discards").

## Decision

### 1. One canonical flat selector on `SendContext`

`SendContext` gains four new fields, flat — no nested `IsolationSelector`
struct (see Rejected alternatives): `ancestor_chain: Option<AncestorChain>`,
`first_party_domain: Option<String>`,
`gecko_view_session_context_id: Option<String>`, and
`origin_attributes: Option<String>`. `AncestorChain` is `SameSite | CrossSite`,
public and `#[non_exhaustive]`. `user_context_id` and `private_browsing_id`
are already flat fields on `SendContext`; the new fields join them as peers,
and every binding maps its context mapping/dict/object keys onto this set
1:1 — bindings never introduce a nested selector object.

**Firefox partition port.** There is no separate port selector and no demand
token for it. The port is derived from the explicit port of the caller's
`top_level_site` URL (`Url::port()`; `None` for the scheme's default port),
because the port a Firefox `partitionKey` records is exactly the top-level
URL's port and asking the caller to state it twice invites the two copies to
disagree.

**Engine encodings this selector must resolve to, at match time:**

- **Chromium.** The persisted key is a schemeful site plus the
  `has_cross_site_ancestor` bit. A stored row matches when its site equals
  the request's normalized `top_level_site` and its stored bit equals
  `ancestor_chain == CrossSite` (`Some(true)` for `CrossSite`, `Some(false)`
  for `SameSite`), where `ancestor_chain` is the *resolved* chain defined
  below. The stored key is parsed as scheme, host, and an optional port, and
  the port must equal the `top_level_site` URL's explicit port (`None` for
  the scheme default) — the same rule as Firefox. Chromium's `SchemefulSite`
  serializes with the scheme's default port, so real http/https keys carry
  none; the previous port-stripping was the one widening step in the module
  and is retired rather than justified.
- **Firefox `partitionKey`.** The tuple grammar is strict:
  `(scheme,host[,port][,f])`. Anything else — extra fields, a malformed
  bracket, a non-numeric port — is `Unparsable`, not "ignore the tail and
  match on scheme+host" (the behavior this ADR retires). A partitioned
  Firefox row (non-empty `partitionKey`) never matches a first-party context
  (`same_site_context`, i.e. `sites_match && resolved_ancestor == SameSite`) — a partition, by
  construction, is not the unpartitioned default context. Otherwise the row
  matches when `site == top_level_site`, `port == derived top-level port`,
  and `f == (sites_match && resolved_ancestor == CrossSite)` — the
  foreign-by-ancestor bit is set exactly for the A→B→A shape, where the
  request and top-level sites match but the resolved chain is cross-site
  (`sites_match` and the resolved chain are defined under "Ancestor chain"
  below; the first term is the raw site comparison, not the narrower
  SameSite gate, which is false whenever the chain is cross-site).
- **Firefox `OriginAttributes` equality.** Every field Mozilla's
  `OriginAttributes` includes in equality is represented:
  `userContextId`, `privateBrowsingId`, `partitionKey` (via the partition
  rule above), `firstPartyDomain`, and `geckoViewSessionContextId`. A stored
  value for one of these attributes is either present (parsed and compared
  exactly against the corresponding selector field) or genuinely absent —
  never silently coerced to a default.

**Unknown stored value is never a default match.** A crate-internal
`StoredIsolation`, computed once per row, parses `origin_attributes` fully:
the five known attribute names plus a catch-all "this attribute name is
present but this build does not know it" fact. Firefox omits default-valued
attributes from the serialized suffix, so the defaults `user_context_id = 0`,
`private_browsing_id = 0`, `first_party_domain = ""`, and
`gecko_view_session_context_id = ""` are filled only when an
`origin_attributes` value is present — an empty string or a bare `^` counts
as present, because Firefox still wrote the column; a `None` column, as on
every Chromium row, does not, and stays genuinely unknown rather than
assumed-default. A value under a *known* attribute name that cannot be read
(`^userContextId=abc`, a JSON `partitionKey` that is not a string) is treated
exactly like an unrecognized name: it fails closed and demands the raw
selector, never a default. A stored `None` (unknown) never matches a supplied
selector, and a supplied selector never matches a stored unrecognized
attribute name: an unrecognized name can only be reached by the exact
`origin_attributes` raw-suffix selector (Decision 5), never inferred from the
five typed fields. Call such a row *opaque* (an unrecognized name, an
unreadable value under a known name, or — for the partition gate below — an
unparsable `partitionKey`). The raw selector governs opaque rows only: an
opaque row is omitted unless the supplied `origin_attributes` equals its
stored suffix byte-for-byte, and an exact match is necessary, not
sufficient — the row still passes through the partition gate and the typed
selectors (an unparsable partition is the one gate the exact match itself
satisfies), so the raw selector is never a bypass; a non-opaque row
ignores the raw selector and is governed by the typed selectors and the
partition verdict alone. Scoping it this way keeps one future-Firefox row
from collapsing every header in that store to a single stored suffix, which
would make unpartitioned and partitioned rows unable to combine. `""` and
`"^"` are distinct raw selectors even though both count as "present" for the
default fill.

**Missing selector is demanded only when observed.** A token is added to
`required` if and only if some row in the snapshot positively observes a
non-default value for that dimension. `None` and `Some(0)` container ids
never demand a token — that would make `header()` unusable against every
store that lacks the column. An `Unparsable` partition key demands
`top_level_site`, but that selector alone cannot identify the row: the send
view omits it under `unparsable_partition_key`. The demand exists so the
snapshot's other, parsable partitioned rows are not silently sent as if the
unparsable one were absent. Any unrecognized attribute name demands
`origin_attributes` on the same logic. Firefox has one exact-match escape
hatch: when `origin_attributes` equals the row's raw suffix, it names an
unparsable partition verbatim and the send view may select that row. This does
not remove the snapshot's `unparsable_partition_key` **read warning**; read
warnings describe stored input, whereas `SendOmissions` counts only rows the
particular send view left out. Thus a selected legacy bare-`baseDomain`
`partitionKey` (or a `moz-extension` top-level scheme) still contributes the
read warning and contributes no send omission. Chromium rows carry no raw
suffix, so an unparsable Chromium key stays unreachable and is omitted from
every send view.

**A supplied selector that matches nothing omits; it never errors.** Once
every demanded token is present in the context, `send_view`/`header` never
fail on account of the selector's values — a `first_party_domain` that
matches no stored row simply results in those rows being omitted (counted
`origin`), the same as any other non-matching context. Only a *missing*
demanded selector produces `IncompleteSendContext`/`IsolationLossRefused`;
a present-but-non-matching one is an ordinary, silent miss.

**Ancestor chain when the caller does not supply one.** Derived as: the
request host equals or is a subdomain of the caller-normalized top-level
site host, on the same scheme, is `SameSite`; otherwise `CrossSite`. **IP
literals are exempt from the subdomain rule.** When either the request host
or the top-level site host is an IPv4 or IPv6 literal, site membership is
exact host equality, never a subdomain check — an IPv6 host is compared
without its brackets, the form `site_from_url` already normalizes to. Call
the outcome of that host comparison `sites_match`. The **resolved** chain is
then: `CrossSite` whenever `sites_match` is false, regardless of any explicit
selector (a same-site chain under a different top-level site is a frame tree
no browser can produce, and honoring it would admit a site's own first-party
partitioned rows into a third-party send); otherwise the explicit selector
if supplied, else `SameSite`. `same_site_context` — the SameSite=Strict/Lax
gate — is `sites_match && resolved == SameSite`, so the two terms are coupled
through the resolved chain: an explicit `CrossSite` on a same-site request
also makes the request cross-site for SameSite purposes, exactly as a
browser treats an A→B→A frame. This is what lets a caller express an A→B→A
embed: `top_level_site` set to the request's own site plus
`ancestor_chain(CrossSite)` selects exactly the A→B→A rows — for Chromium,
rows whose partition site equals the request site with
`has_cross_site_ancestor == true`; for Firefox, rows whose `partitionKey`
tuple is `(scheme,site,f)` with `site` equal to the request site — and omits
`SameSite=Strict`/`Lax` rows. `top_level_site` cannot be absent in that
call: any partitioned row demands it, so the no-top-level-site default never
reaches partition matching. The same subdomain rule (with the same
IP-literal exemption) now governs `sites_match` for the SameSite gate that
`header()` already applied before this ADR — previously a literal host
comparison. This is the one
semantic change to already-shipped SameSite behavior this ADR makes: a
request to `www.example.com` with `top_level_site=https://example.com` was
`CrossSite` before this ADR and is `SameSite` after it; two sibling
subdomains (`a.example.com` embedded under `b.example.com`) stay `CrossSite`
either way, because neither is a subdomain of the other. The subdomain
membership change by itself only widens: it adds cookies previously withheld
because the request host was a child of the top-level host. The full 0.7
selector can also narrow: an explicit `ancestor_chain(CrossSite)` withholds
`SameSite=Lax` and `SameSite=Strict` cookies even when the request and
top-level sites match, as the A→B→A case above requires. It replaces the
retired test
`a_sibling_subdomain_is_cross_site_because_there_is_no_public_suffix_list`
with sibling-stays-cross-site and child-becomes-same-site cases (see
Decision 4 for why this remains sound without a public-suffix list).

**Stored Chromium ancestor bit `None` on a partitioned row fails closed.** A
Chromium row that declares a partition (`top_frame_site_key` is present) but
whose `has_cross_site_ancestor` column is absent, `NULL`, or not `0`/`1` —
in practice a store last written by a Chromium that predates the column — is
omitted from every send view regardless of the requested `ancestor_chain`,
counted under `SendOmissions::ancestor_chain_unknown`, and counted at read
time as the new `ReadWarning` code `unknown_ancestor_chain` (mirroring
`unparsable_partition_key`). A caller cannot supply a selector that resolves
this ambiguity — there is no "unknown" value on `AncestorChain` to select —
because the row's own stored identity, not the caller's context, is what is
missing. Chromium's own schema migration may backfill a value for such rows
when it next opens the store; this crate deliberately does not infer that
value, and a store opened by a current Chromium will not exhibit the case.

### 2. `send_view` is the single selection operation

`ReadResult::send_view(&self, &SendContext) -> Result<SendView<'_>>` is the
one place that walks the snapshot and decides, per row, whether it is sent.
`header()` becomes a thin renderer over `send_view`'s result — it does not
reimplement matching, and neither do the Python, Node, or CLI surfaces.
Every binding's send-selecting entry point (`send_view`/`sendView`/
`send-view`, and `header`/`header` for all of them) is documented as calling
through this one operation, so a collision case that passes in Rust cannot
silently diverge in a binding that grew its own copy of the predicate.

`SendOmissions` names a fixed, stable set of reasons a row is not sent:
`expired`, `not_applicable` (fails `GetFilter`, i.e. domain/path/Secure),
`same_site`, `partition` (isolation mismatch other than an unknown ancestor
bit or an unparsable key), `ancestor_chain_unknown`, `unparsable_partition_key`,
and `origin` (Firefox origin-attributes mismatch other than
partition/ancestor). Attribution and serialization are two different orders,
and this ADR fixes both independently:

- **Attribution order** is the row evaluation order: expired, then the
  domain/path/Secure filter (`not_applicable`), then the isolation verdict
  reasons (`partition` / `ancestor_chain_unknown` / `unparsable_partition_key`
  / `origin`), then `same_site`. Each row is counted under its first failing
  reason in this order and never double-counted — a row that is both expired
  and cross-site is counted `expired`, not `same_site`.
- **Serialization order** is the order above the two bullets list — the
  stable order `SendOmissions::entries()` yields regardless of how many rows
  landed in each bucket. Bindings surface this order verbatim rather than
  re-deriving it. It is not the attribution order and must not be read as
  one: `same_site` sorts before the isolation reasons in `entries()` even
  though isolation is checked before `same_site` when a row is evaluated.

### 3. Fail-closed jar, explicit opt-in for isolation loss

`IsolationLoss` is a new public, `#[non_exhaustive]` enum:
`Refuse` (the default) or `Allow`. `ReadResult::jar(&self) -> Result<&[Cookie]>`
and `into_jar(self) -> Result<Vec<Cookie>>` are the new fail-closed default
entry points; they succeed exactly when the snapshot has no positively
isolated row (the same "demanded selectors would be non-empty" predicate
Decision 1 defines — a jar refuses whenever *some* context would need a
selector to disambiguate what it holds, without asking which context). The
explicit opt-in is `jar_with(&self, IsolationLoss)` /
`into_jar_with(self, IsolationLoss)`. The free function `jar(request)` is
sugar for `read(request)?.into_jar()` — it inherits the fail-closed default,
not the old always-succeeds behavior. A refusal is a new typed error,
`RequestError::IsolationLossRefused { isolated_rows: u64, required: Vec<String> }`,
code `isolation_loss_refused`, whose `required` reuses the exact selector
tokens `IncompleteSendContext` already defines (Decision 5) — a caller
branching on `required` does not need a second vocabulary.

`cookies()` / `into_cookies()` (Rust), `as_list()` (Python), and the `cookies`
getter (Node) are unaffected by this decision: they remain infallible and
are the *inventory* projection — a caller explicitly asking to see the raw
eight-field rows, isolation collisions included, for display or auditing
rather than for sending. Only the names that promise send-safety (`jar`,
`as_jar`) gain the fail-closed contract. Opted-in output
(`jar_with(IsolationLoss::Allow)` and its binding equivalents) is byte-for-byte
identical to the pre-ADR always-succeeding output for the same snapshot —
this ADR changes when a request can fail, never what a successful jar
contains.

### 4. No public-suffix list; caller-normalized `top_level_site`

`Site` remains `(scheme, literal host)`, not an eTLD+1/registrable-domain
comparison, and this ADR does not add a public-suffix dataset. The e2e
lane's own context construction already normalizes `top_level_site` to a
schemeful site before calling in
(`tests/e2e/assert_partitioned_context.py:46`), which is the shape this
decision formalizes as the contract rather than an incidental test detail:
the caller must supply `top_level_site` as an already-normalized registrable
site, and the library never attempts to infer a registrable boundary from a
bare hostname. This keeps `SameSite` conservative in the direction that
matters for a security-facing crate — Decision 1's subdomain widening only
ever adds matches a caller-normalized site says are legitimately same-site,
and a caller who under-normalizes (passes a host one level too specific)
gets *fewer* matches, never more.

This is the cost this decision accepts, stated plainly: without a
public-suffix list, the library cannot itself tell a registrable domain
(`example.com`) from a public suffix (`github.io`, `co.uk`). If a caller
passes a public suffix as `top_level_site`, Decision 1's subdomain rule
treats every host under it as same-site — `a.github.io` and `b.github.io`
would both derive `SameSite` against `top_level_site=https://github.io`,
which is wrong for two unrelated GitHub Pages sites. This is not a defect
this ADR closes; it is the caller-normalization contract's known failure
mode, and it is why `top_level_site` must be the actual registrable site a
caller controls, never an unvalidated hostname passed through from a
request.

### 5. Stable token vocabulary and canonical order

Demand tokens are appended, never reordered, and never removed:
`top_level_site`, `user_context_id`, `private_browsing_id`,
`first_party_domain`, `gecko_view_session_context_id`, `origin_attributes`.
`ancestor_chain` and the Firefox partition port are never demanded — both
are derived (Decision 1), so there is no selector-shaped hole for a caller to
fill for them. This is the same list `IncompleteSendContext.required` and
the new `IsolationLossRefused.required` both draw from, so a caller who
handles one error's `required` field already knows the vocabulary for the
other.

### 6. CLI structured error object rule

The documented rule for a CLI JSON error object is: every error object
carries `code` and `message`; a given `code` may define additional
documented fields. Today `render_cli_error` emits only `code` and `message`
for every code, including `incomplete_send_context` — the CLI has never
surfaced `required` (only the Python and Node bindings do today). `required`
is new to the CLI in this program, defined for exactly two codes:
`incomplete_send_context` and the new `isolation_loss_refused`, both landing
together (PR 3). A consumer parsing CLI error JSON must ignore unknown keys
rather than reject them, so this rule can add a field to a `code` in the
future without breaking existing consumers.

## Consequences

### Migration, per language

- **Rust.** `SendContext` gains the four builder methods from Decision 1.
  `send_view` is new. `header` is unchanged in signature and continues to
  work with existing calls; its behavior changes only for the collision
  cases Decision 1 newly disambiguates (previously-merged rows now split, or
  a previously-silent-default unknown attribute now demands
  `origin_attributes`). `ReadResult::jar()`/`into_jar()` do not exist today —
  today's infallible flatten is reached only via `into_cookies()`/`cookies()`
  or the free `jar(request)` function — so these are new, `Result`-returning
  methods, not a signature change to an existing one. The free `jar(request)`
  function keeps its existing `Result`-returning signature and gains a new
  failure mode (`IsolationLossRefused`); existing unpartitioned-snapshot
  callers keep seeing `Ok` exactly as before. `jar_with`/`into_jar_with` and
  the `IsolationLoss` enum are new. Public-API snapshots for PR 2 are
  additions only.
- **Python.** `ReadResult.send_view(...)` is new, returning the detailed
  selected set, header string, and omission counts. `as_jar()` and the free
  `jar()` both gain `allow_isolation_loss: bool = False`; the default keeps
  today's call sites working for unpartitioned snapshots and raises the new
  structured error otherwise. `ReadResult.compatibility_cookies(*, allow_isolation_loss=False)`
  is the new named escape hatch that makes the fail-closed/opt-in policy
  explicit without going through the jar-shaped API. `as_list()` is
  unaffected.
- **Node.** `ReadResult.sendView(context)` is new. `jar` gains a
  `JarOptions` with `allowIsolationLoss` (not added to `ReadOptions`, where
  it would be silently ignored by every non-jar call). `snapshot.cookies` is
  unaffected.
- **CLI.** New `send-view` subcommand, printing the selected detailed set,
  header, and omission counts as one JSON object. New `--allow-isolation-loss`
  flag on `read`/`from-path` for `--format json|netscape`. New selector flags
  (`--ancestor-chain`, `--first-party-domain`,
  `--gecko-view-session-context-id`, `--origin-attributes`) on `header` and
  `send-view`.

None of the above renames an existing name. `jar`/`as_jar`/`jar()` keep their
names in every language; what changes is that they can now fail, and that an
explicit, named opt-in exists for the caller who has already decided
isolation loss is acceptable.

## Out of scope

- A public-suffix list or any registrable-domain dataset (Decision 4).
- Browser-side policy heuristics: storage-access grants, First-Party Sets,
  and any related-site-set membership.
- Nonce-keyed / ephemeral partitions that do not persist to disk.
- Firefox CHIPS cookies set in a first-party context. Firefox persists them
  with `partitionKey=(https,site)` like any partition, and the rule above
  that a partitioned Firefox row never matches a first-party context
  withholds them where the browser would send them. That is the conservative
  direction; relaxing it is recorded as an open question in the program
  record.
- A Firefox port-partitioning e2e lane. Firefox records the port in
  `partitionKey` whenever the top-level URL has a non-default one, under the
  default configuration; such a lane needs a top-level page on a
  non-default port, not a pref. The port rule in Decision 1 is unit- and
  corpus-tested, not exercised against a live browser in this program.
  (`privacy.dynamic_firstparty.use_site=false` instead reverts to the legacy
  bare-`baseDomain` key without parentheses, which the strict grammar
  reports as unparsable and the raw `origin_attributes` selector can still
  name.)
- `from-path --domains`: it stays a flat, compatibility-only route and is not
  extended with the new selector surface. Whether it should gain one is an
  open question in the program record, not a decision this ADR makes.
- Redesigning `CookieContext` extraction. Issue #177 already covers what
  `CookieContext` captures and how; this ADR only adds crate-internal
  selection logic (`StoredIsolation`) over the fields #177 already delivers,
  and Rejected alternatives 3 and 4 above are why no new public field is
  added to `CookieContext` itself.
- Changing the report schema. Report schema v1 stays the frozen eight-field
  diagnostic DTO; nothing in this ADR touches `schema/report-dto.schema.json`
  or `ExtractionReport` (see "Does not amend" above). A schema-version
  change, if one is ever needed to carry isolation identity through the
  report path, is a separate proposal.

## Rejected alternatives

1. **A nested `IsolationSelector` struct on `SendContext`**, as the original
   issue's Phase 1 sketch proposed. `SendContext` already has flat
   `user_context_id`/`private_browsing_id` fields from the 0.6.0 selector
   work; nesting the four new fields under a second struct would give the
   type two different shapes for what is, to a caller, one flat list of
   "what I know about this request." Every binding's context mapping would
   also need a nested-object convention with no existing precedent in this
   crate. Rejected in favor of Decision 1's flat fields.
2. **Renaming `jar`/`as_jar` to an explicitly lossy name** (e.g. `flat_jar`,
   `lossy_jar`) instead of making them fail closed. This was one of the two
   options the issue's Phase 3 left open. A rename changes every existing
   call site's spelling for no behavioral gain to an unpartitioned-snapshot
   caller, and it does not stop a partitioned-snapshot caller from getting a
   silently wrong answer — it only renames the trap. Fail-closed-by-default
   (Decision 3) is strictly safer: the common case (no isolation in the
   snapshot) is unaffected, and the dangerous case now requires an
   affirmative, named choice instead of an affirmative, differently-named
   function call that looks just as safe as the old one.
3. **A tri-state public `CookieContext`** (`Some(value)` / `Some(default)` /
   `Unknown`) to represent Decision 1's unknown-vs-default distinction on the
   public snapshot type directly. `CookieContext` is unchanged by this ADR:
   the unknown/default distinction is computed once, crate-internally, by
   `StoredIsolation`, and never promoted to a third public state. Widening
   the public type would be a larger, harder-to-reverse public API change for
   a distinction only the selection algorithm needs to see.
4. **Adding new public fields to `CookieContext`** to carry the parsed
   `AncestorChain`, parsed Firefox tuple parts, or parsed origin-attribute
   values directly. Rejected for the same reason as alternative 3: this is
   derived, selection-time state, not additional inventory a caller
   inspecting `detailed_cookies()` needs, and adding fields there would grow
   the public snapshot surface for every language without a caller-facing
   use beyond what `send_view`'s omission counts already answer.
5. **Putting isolation-loss policy on `ReadRequest`** (an option on `read`
   itself, deciding at snapshot-construction time whether isolated rows are
   even retained). Rejected because it would make the same snapshot behave
   differently depending on a flag chosen before the caller knows what the
   snapshot contains, and it would prevent a caller from inspecting isolated
   rows via `detailed_cookies()`/`send_view` while still refusing to jar them
   — the two questions ("what did the browser store" and "am I willing to
   flatten it") are answered by different call sites, not one.
